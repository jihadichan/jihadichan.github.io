Prompt v2

Transcribe the given audio. The audio is structured like this:
1. English sentence
2. Mandarin translation, repeated 3 times.

In your transcript, do not repeat the translation. Once is enough.
Format your transcript as a JSON object with the exact structure specified below.
The JSON must include a component breakdown with short explanations and a note explaining important concepts in the sentence. Also include a word-by-word translation in the format `让 (Let) 我们 (us) 吃 (eat) 午饭 (lunch).`.

IMPORTANT:
- The Mandarin transcript MUST use Simplified Chinese. DO NOT use Traditional Chinese.
- Make sure to replicate the JSON structure precisely with all specified fields in the given order.
- Transcribe the whole audio file, not just an excerpt.
