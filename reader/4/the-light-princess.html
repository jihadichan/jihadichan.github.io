        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很久很久以前，有一位国王和他的王后，非常想要一个孩子。但是，日子一天天过去了，他们一直没有孩子。慢慢地，国王失去了耐心。<br>
            “我的王后！”&nbsp;一天，国王对王后抱怨说，“我们需要一个孩子！其他国王都有孩子，而且很多！知道吗？有一个国王竟然有12个孩子！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Once upon a time, a king and queen longed for a child. However, as the years passed, they still didn’t have a child. Gradually the king lost his patience.<br>
            "My queen!" he moaned one day. "We need a child! Other kings have children, and lots of them! Did you know? One king even has 12 children!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后扬了扬眉毛：“12个孩子吗？”&nbsp;她拍了拍国王的胳膊，“我们也会有的，要有耐心。”&nbsp;<br>
            国王一边走一边叹气。王宫外面有一个美丽的湖。国王心情不好的时候，沿着湖边散散步，心情就会好很多。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The queen lifted an eyebrow. "Twelve children?" She patted the king's arm. "Our turn will come. Just be patient."<br>
            The king sighed while walking outside. There was a beautiful lake outside the palace. When the king was in a bad mood, walking along the lake made him feel better.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，王后就生了一个孩子。<br>
            “多么漂亮的小公主！”&nbsp;国王非常高兴，“我们就叫她艾伦吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            国王和王后开始为孩子的洗礼做准备。国王负责写请柬。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon the queen gave birth to a child.<br>
            "A beautiful daughter!" The king was very happy. "We'll name her Ellen!"  <br>
            The king and queen began planning the baby's baptism. The king was in charge of sending out invitations.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是他太着急了，不小心忘了一个人。他忘了邀请他的姐姐艾格尼丝。<br>
            你可能会感到惊讶，国王怎么会忘记邀请自己的姐姐呢？其实，这些年，国王一直都在努力地让自己忘记她！忘记这个脾气不好，而且十分恶毒的女人！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But he was in such a hurry, he forgot someone. He forgot to invite his sister, Lady Agnes.<br>
            This might surprise you. How could the king forget to invite his own sister? As a matter of fact, for many, many years, the king had been trying to forget her! He had tried to forget the sour, spiteful woman!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            事实上，没有人喜欢艾格尼丝，就连她的黑猫也不喜欢她。她的额头很大，脸上全是难看的皱纹。当她生气时，眼睛会闪着蓝光；当她非常生气时，眼睛会闪着黄色和绿色的光。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In fact, no one liked Agnes, not even her black cat. She had a huge forehead and a face filled with ugly wrinkles. When she was mad, her eyes flashed blue. When she was really mad, they flashed yellow and green.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            哦！艾格尼丝还有一个大家都不知道的秘密。她是一个女巫——&nbsp;一个非常邪恶的女巫！<br>
            公主出生的消息传遍了整个王国。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Oh, and Agnes had a dark secret, which few people knew. She was a witch—a very wicked witch!<br>
            The news about the birth of the princess spread through the kingdom.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “王宫里将会举行一场特别的洗礼。”&nbsp;艾格尼丝说，“我也会被邀请的！”&nbsp;<br>
            艾格尼丝每天都查看她的信件。但是每天的结果都一样——没有来自国王的请柬！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There will be a special baptism at the palace," Agnes said. "And I will be invited!"<br>
            Each day Agnes checked her mail. Each day she found the same thing—no invitation from the king!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哼！”&nbsp;艾格尼丝生气地跺了跺脚，“希望我的弟弟没有忘记我！”&nbsp;<br>
            终于到了洗礼的日子。艾格尼丝也终于下定了决心。<br>
            “没有请柬我也要去！”&nbsp;艾格尼丝穿上她最好的衣服，上了马车。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Grr." Agnes stomped her foot. "I hope my brother didn't forget about me!"  <br>
            The day of the baptism finally arrived. By now Agnes' mind was made up. <br>
            "I'll go to the baptism without an invitation!" she said. She put on her best dress and climbed into a carriage.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            马车走向王宫，艾格尼丝的眼睛闪着黄色和绿色的光，“等着瞧！我那无礼的弟弟再也不会忘记我了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As she traveled toward the palace, Agnes' eyes flashed yellow and green. "Just you wait! My rude brother will never forget about me again!"

            洗礼日这天，国王和王后正在等待客人们的到来。保姆站在他们旁边，怀里抱着还是婴儿的小公主。<br>
            “多么美好的一天呐！”&nbsp;国王说，“我们的朋友和家人马上就要来了！……啊，坏了！”&nbsp;他拍了拍额头，“艾格尼丝来了，我忘了给她发请柬！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was the day of the baptism. The king and queen waited for the guests to arrive. A nanny stood nearby, holding the baby princess.<br>
            "What a wonderful day," the king said. "Our friends and family are coming! Oh no!" He slapped his forehead. "There's Lady Agnes. I forgot to send her an invitation!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他向艾格尼丝挥了挥手：“欢迎欢迎，我的姐姐！”&nbsp;<br>
            艾格尼丝皱起眉头：“你忘了邀请我，但我还是来了。”&nbsp;她的眼睛闪着蓝色的光，“我绝对不会错过这个......特别的日子！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He waved. "Welcome, Sister."<br>
            Agnes frowned. "You forgot to invite me, but I came anyway." Her eyes flashed blue. "I would never miss this . . . special day."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王转身去迎接其他客人。艾格尼丝在王宫里一边走一边寻找洗礼池。<br>
            洗礼池是神父用圣水祝福婴儿的地方。艾格尼丝走过去，站在洗礼池旁边。<br>
            很快，大家都来到洗礼池周围，神父正要把杯子放入水中。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king turned to greet more guests. Agnes looked around for the font. <br>
            That was where a priest would bless the baby with water. Agnes walked over and stood next to it.<br>
            Soon everyone gathered around the font. The priest was about to dip a cup into the water.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “就是现在！”&nbsp;艾格尼丝心想。<br>
            她把魔法药水抛洒进洗礼池的水中，然后原地转了三圈，低声念了一个咒语：
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Now!" Agnes thought. <br>
            She tossed a potion into the water. Then she spun around three times and whispered a spell.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            灵魂轻轻，听我命令！<br>
            身体轻轻，空中飘零！<br>
            不压弯人的胳膊，<br>
            只压碎父母的心！

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Light of spirit, by my charms.<br>

            Just crush your parents' heart!

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            哭着的婴儿突然咯咯笑了起来，保姆这时也惊讶地叫了一声。她没有告诉任何人，现在的艾伦公主感觉比空气还轻！<br>
            刚开始，没有人意识到出了什么问题。但在洗礼后不久，发生了一件奇怪的事情。艾伦公主从保姆的怀里飘了出去！小小的婴儿一边咯咯笑着一边踢着脚，在房间里飘来飘去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The crying baby suddenly laughed, and Nanny let out a gasp. She didn't tell anyone that now Ellen felt lighter than air! <br>
            At first no one realized something was wrong. But soon after the baptism, there was an odd event. Ellen flew out of Nanny's arms! The tiny baby kicked and laughed as she floated around the room.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “快来帮忙啊！”&nbsp;保姆大喊。<br>
            一个仆人冲了进来，保姆指着天花板：“公主飘起来了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Help!" Nanny cried. <br>
            A servant rushed in, and Nanny pointed to the ceiling. <br>
            "The princess is floating!" she said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            仆人跑去拿来了梯子。保姆爬上梯子，抓住公主把她抱了下来。<br>
            后来，同样的事情又发生了，这次是国王抱着公主。<br>
            “真奇怪啊，王后！”&nbsp;他皱起眉头，“我感觉不到艾伦在我怀里，就像......”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The servant ran for a ladder. Nanny climbed up to fetch the princess.          <br>
            Later it happened again. This time the king was holding the baby. <br>
            "How odd, my queen." He frowned. "I can't feel Ellen in my arms. It's as if . . . ah!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公主从他的怀里飘了出去，她笑着在空中跳起了舞。<br>
            “快来人呐！”&nbsp;国王大喊。<br>
            仆人拿着梯子跑了过来。他爬上去，用一个大夹子把公主从空中夹了下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess floated out of his arms. She laughed and danced in the air. <br>
            "Help!" the king cried. <br>
            The servant came running with the ladder. He climbed up and grabbed the baby with a pair of tongs.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王转头，看着王后。&nbsp;<br>
            国王倒吸了一口气：“公主太轻了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “对！”&nbsp;王后惊恐地说，“公主完全没有重量！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king turned over and looked at the queen.<br>
            The king gulped. "The princess is too light!"<br>
            "Yes," the queen said in horror. "Her gravity is gone!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “为什么公主会没有重量呢？”&nbsp;国王走来走去，“王后，这不可能是我们的孩子！肯定是有人带走了她，然后留下了这个没有重量的孩子！”&nbsp;<br>
            “别说傻话了，亲爱的。”&nbsp;王后说，“我觉得肯定有别的原因。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why doesn't the princess have gravity?" The king paced back and forth. "My queen, this child can't be ours. Someone took our baby and gave us this light one instead!" <br>
            "Don't be silly, dear," the queen said. "I think something else caused this problem."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “别的原因？”&nbsp;国王问道。<br>
            “洗礼时，我们没有好好照看艾伦，而且……”&nbsp;王后清了清嗓子，“有一个没被邀请的人离艾伦太近了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Something else?" the king asked.<br>
            "We didn't watch Ellen carefully at the baptism. And . . . " The queen cleared her throat. "Someone who was not invited got too close to her."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊，对！”&nbsp;国王拍了拍额头，“我知道了！肯定是我的姐姐给公主施了咒语！”&nbsp;<br>
            “没错。”&nbsp;王后伤心地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Aha!" The king slapped his forehead. "I get it. My sister put a spell on her!"<br>
            "Exactly," the queen said sadly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            虽然每个人都尽了最大的努力照看公主，但事故还是在不断发生。一个晴朗的夏日，小公主睡着了，保姆轻轻地把她放进小床里，然后给她盖上毯子，并且把毯子固定住。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone did their best to watch the baby princess. But accidents kept happening. For example, one fine summer day, Nanny put her to sleep. She covered the princess with a blanket, and fixed the blanket.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，王后走进了房间。她没有看到正在熟睡的公主。<br>
            “天气真好哇！”&nbsp;王后说，“呼吸一些新鲜空气吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            她打开窗户，然后就离开了房间。她不知道，外面飘来了一个调皮的风精灵，它在窗户的周围飘来飘去，就等着捣乱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later the queen entered the room. She didn't see the sleeping princess.<br>
            "What a nice day!" the queen said. "I'll let in some fresh air." <br>
            She opened a window and then hurried off. She didn't realize a naughty fairy wind was blowing outside. It swirled around the window, waiting to do some mischief.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后刚一离开，风精灵就冲了进来。它飞舞着来到床边，卷起艾伦，然后慢慢地飘了出去。公主就像花瓣那样，在空中飘来飘去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As soon as the queen left, the fairy wind rushed in. It danced over to the bed and swept up Ellen. Then it blew back outside. The small baby floated on the breeze like a petal.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            保姆回来发现公主不见了！她努力冷静下来。<br>
            “一定是王后把公主抱走了。”&nbsp;她想。<br>
            她跑向王后的房间。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Nanny returned and found that the princess was gone! Nanny tried to stay calm. <br>
            "The queen probably took her," she thought.<br>
            She ran to the queen's room.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “王后，艾伦公主在您这里吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “没有。”&nbsp;王后的脸色一下子变得苍白，“公主不见了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “恐怕……是这样……”&nbsp;保姆回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Your Majesty, do you have Princess Ellen?"<br>
            "No." The queen went pale. "Is she missing?"<br>
            "I'm afraid . . . so . . . " Nanny said.

    </div>
    <div>

            王后大声呼救。不一会儿，王宫里就忙乱得像蜜蜂窝。每个人都跑来跑去，寻找失踪的公主。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The queen yelled for help. A moment later the palace was as busy as a beehive. Everyone buzzed about, searching for the missing princess.<br>
            Finally a shout rang out: "I found her!".

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大家都急忙跑向花园。公主躺在玫瑰花丛下，睡得甜甜的。她的身上盖着一层厚厚的玫瑰花瓣。<br>
            国王和王后松了一口气，忍不住哭了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone ran out to the garden. The baby lay under a rosebush, sound asleep. A thick blanket of rose petals covered her.<br>
            The king and queen sobbed with relief.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            哭声把艾伦吵醒了，艾伦咯咯笑了起来。她开心地踢着小脚，把玫瑰花瓣踢得到处都是。

            The noise woke up Ellen, who laughed and laughed. She kicked her tiny feet, spraying rose petals everywhere.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After that, Ellen was never left alone. Everyone held her tightly so she couldn't float away. Her bed and carriage had ribbons. No matter where she went, she was tied.

            "My gold coins have weight," he thought sadly. "Yet my daughter weighs nothing at all."<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，国王听到有人在哭。是王后！<br>
            国王急忙向她跑去：“我的王后，怎么了？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们的艾伦怎么办？”&nbsp;王后哭着说，“她太轻了，如果我们再失去她怎么办？”&nbsp;王后擤了擤鼻涕。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A moment later the king heard someone crying. It was the queen.<br>
            The king hurried to her. "What's wrong, my queen?" <br>
            "What should we do with Ellen?" the queen said while crying. "She is so light. What if we lose her again?" She blew her nose.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这确实是个大问题！”&nbsp;国王担忧地说，“想想艾伦结婚生子后会发生什么？我们的王国将到处都是飘着的婴儿！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我有一个主意。”&nbsp;王后慢慢地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's a big worry," the king said glumly. "And what will happen when Ellen gets married and has children? Our kingdom will be filled with floating babies!" <br>
            "I have an idea," the queen said slowly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王笑了：“我的王后，你总是有好主意！是什么主意？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你可以去拜访一下你的姐姐。”&nbsp;王后说。<br>
            国王紧张地咳嗽起来：“去……拜访艾格尼丝？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king smiled. "You always have good ideas, my queen. What is this one?"<br>
            "You could visit your sister," she said.<br>
            The king coughed nervously. "Visit . . . Lady Agnes?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的，向她道歉，说我们不是故意忘记邀请她的。”&nbsp;王后说，“然后你必须请求她解除咒语。求求你了，亲爱的！”&nbsp;<br>
            国王叹了口气，拍了拍王后的肩膀：“别哭了，我明天就去。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes. Tell her we're sorry. We didn't mean to forget her invitation," the queen said. "And then you must beg her to remove the spell. Please, dear!" <br>
            The king sighed and patted his wife's shoulder. "Dry your tears. I'll go tomorrow."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            第二天早上，国王去拜访艾格尼丝。仆人端来了茶。<br>
            “我……嗯……”&nbsp;国王揉搓着手里的餐巾纸，“最近一切都好吧？我来找你，是想谈一件非常重要的事情。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning the king went to visit Lady Agnes. A servant brought tea.<br>
            "I . . . er . . . " The king fumbled with his napkin. "I hope you're well, Agnes. I came to talk to you about something important."

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾格尼丝眯起眼睛：“是吗？”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Agnes narrowed her eyes. "Yes?"<br>
            "It's the spell," the king said. "You were angry I forgot to invite you to the baptism. So you put a spell on Ellen. And now the princess is . . . "

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “咒语？”&nbsp;艾格尼丝大声笑了起来，“多么可笑！你还是像以前一样，太没有耐心了，弟弟！等你的傻女儿长大，她自然就不会那么轻了。现在，你只需要耐心地……改正你的品行！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "A spell?" Agnes laughed loudly. "How ridiculous! As usual, you're much too impatient, brother. Your silly daughter will grow out of her lightness someday. You just need to be patient . . . and mend your ways."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “改正我的品行？”&nbsp;国王说，“你这是什么意思？”&nbsp;<br>
            “意思就是，你要努力成为一个更好的人。”&nbsp;艾格尼丝冷笑着，“我来教你！就从多尊重你的姐姐开始！”&nbsp;

            日子一天天过去了，艾伦渐渐长大了。她会在口袋里放些石头，这样她就不会飘起来了。<br>
            她的父母也越来越喜欢这个&nbsp;“轻轻公主”&nbsp;。因为有艾伦，王宫里总是充满了笑声，生活总是充满了快乐！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Time passed, and Ellen grew up. She got used to keeping rocks in her pockets. This kept her from floating away.<br>
            And her parents began to enjoy having a “light princess.” With Ellen, the palace always rang with laughter. Life was always fun!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾伦17岁的时候，她的父母又开始担心起来。虽然艾伦的笑声让每个人都很开心，但她对所有的一切都是笑嘻嘻的，哪怕是不好的事情。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            By the time Ellen was 17, her parents were uneasy again. Yes, Ellen delighted everyone with her laughter. But she laughed at everything; even things that were not funny.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            比如，每当王后哭泣的时候，艾伦就会咯咯笑着说：“嘻嘻！妈妈，你的脸又出水了！”&nbsp;<br>
            每当国王发火的时候，艾伦就会像蝴蝶一样在他身边飞来飞去，大笑着说：“爸爸，再做一次生气的表情！你看起来真傻！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For instance, whenever the queen cried, Ellen giggled. "Hee-hee! Mama, you're squeezing water out of your cheeks again!"<br>
            Whenever the king yelled, Ellen floated around him like a butterfly, grinning. "Make that mean face again, Papa! You look silly!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有一天，尴尬的事情发生了。艾伦正和两个仆人一起散步，她们紧紧地抓着公主的手。突然，艾伦看到了国王，她抽出一只手挥了挥：“爸爸！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then one day something awkward happened. Ellen was crossing the lawn with two servants. They held her hands tightly. But when Ellen saw her father, she yanked one hand away. <br>
            "Papa!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾伦想找一些石头放在口袋里，但她看到了一只又大又黑的癞蛤蟆。她抓住它，然后向国王跑去。她伸开双臂，想要亲吻他。<br>
            突然，一阵风吹过，把公主吹向了旁边的侍卫——她飞进了年轻侍卫的怀里！啵！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Ellen looked for rocks to put in her pockets. But all she saw was a big black toad. She grabbed it and started running. She held out her arms, ready to kiss her father.<br>
            Suddenly there was a puff of wind. The princess flew in another direction—into a young page's arms. Smack!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公主亲在了侍卫的脸上，然后她举起癞蛤蟆，在另一边脸上打了一下！<br>
            公主咯咯笑了起来：“希望你喜欢这只癞蛤蟆！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess planted a kiss on one of the page's cheeks. On the other cheek, she slapped him—with the huge black toad! <br>
            The princess giggled. "I hope you like toads!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公主一直不停地笑，国王的脸红了。“这太尴尬了！”&nbsp;他想，“必须得做点儿什么了。”&nbsp;<br>
            第二天早上，国王和王后派人叫来公主。艾伦的口袋里只有几颗小石头，所以她花了很长时间才坐下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king turned red as she shrieked with laughter. "This is so embarrassing!" he thought. "Something must be done." <br>
            The next morning the king and queen sent for the princess. She had only a few small stones in her pockets. So it took her a while to sit down.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王清了清嗓子：“艾伦，你知道你和其他人是不一样的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不，没有什么不一样！”&nbsp;艾伦笑了，“我也是一个鼻子、两只眼睛和一张嘴，和其他人一样。”&nbsp;<br>
            “认真点儿！”&nbsp;王后说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king cleared his throat. "Ellen, you know you're different from everyone." <br>
            "No, I'm not!" Ellen laughed. "I have a nose, two eyes, and a mouth, like everyone else."<br>
            "Be serious," her mother said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不，我就喜欢傻傻的！”&nbsp;艾伦又不停地笑了起来。<br>
            国王看着王后：“现在怎么办？”&nbsp;<br>
            “只有一个办法了。”&nbsp;王后说，“必须请柯普和哈姆来了——我们王国最聪明的两位哲学家。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, thank you. I like being silly!" Ellen laughed and laughed.<br>
            The king looked at his wife. "Now what?" <br>
            "There's only one thing to do," she said. "We must send for Kopp and Humm—the kingdom's wisest philosophers."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A servant led Kopp and Humm into the throne room. The king explained his daughter's condition. The two wise philosophers listened carefully.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Now tell us," the king said. "What is the cure for our daughter's problem?" <br>
            Kopp spoke up first. "I know what's wrong. The wrong soul is in the princess’ body." <br>
            The queen blinked in surprise. "I don't understand."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我来解释一下，”&nbsp;柯普说，“当婴儿出生时，他们必须要等待自己的灵魂，但这需要一些时间。我认为，是公主的身体里进入了错误的灵魂。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你在说什么火星语？”&nbsp;国王很生气。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let me explain," Kopp said. "When babies are born, they must wait for their souls to arrive. This takes some time. And I think the wrong soul arrived in the princess' body."<br>
            "What Martian language are you speaking?" the king snapped.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “火星？不不不，陛下！不是火星，我认为艾伦公主的灵魂来自水星。不过不用担心，”&nbsp;柯普很快又说，“有一个非常简单的方法。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Mars? No, Your Majesty! Not Mars. I believe Ellen's soul came from the planet Mercury. But don't worry," Kopp said quickly. "There's a simple cure for this problem."

            "Whew!" The king smiled. "Finally some good news." <br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “必须教她有关我们星球的一切。”&nbsp;柯普说，“我们的动物和植物。”&nbsp;他拍了拍下巴，“当然！还有艺术和文学。这都需要时间，但是……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You must teach her all about our planet," Kopp said. "She must learn about our animals and plants." He tapped his chin. "And of course someone must also teach her about art and literature. It will take time, but—"

    </div>
    <div>

            “不！不！不！”&nbsp;哈姆大声喊道，“他说的完全不对！现在轮到我了。我很清楚公主出了什么问题，是她的身体——她的血液出了问题！”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No . . . no . . . no!" Humm roared. "That's completely wrong! It's my turn now. And I know exactly what's wrong with the princess. There's a problem with her body—in her blood." <br>
            "Her blood?" The queen was surprised.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;哈姆点了点头，“公主的血液流向了错误的方向，这就是她没有重量的原因。虽然不知道原因，但是想要治好她，就必须先给她洗个热水澡，然后还需要准备……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes." Humm nodded. "Her blood is flowing through her body in the wrong direction. That's why she lacks gravity. I don't know what caused it. To cure her, you must first put her in a warm bath. Then you'll need . . . "
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “够了！”&nbsp;国王非常生气，“你们也许是最聪明的哲学家，但你们的想法实在是太可笑了！”&nbsp;<br>
            王后点了点头：“希望你们能在王宫里住几天。仔细观察一下公主，然后再把你们的想法告诉我们。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Enough!" the king cried. "You may be wise philosophers. But your ideas are ridiculous!"<br>
            The queen nodded. "Why don't you two stay at the palace for a few days. Watch the princess closely. Then tell us what you think."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是，两位哲学家住进了王宫。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And so the two philosophers moved into the palace. <br>

            仆人想要拉住她，但她又游走了。公主像天鹅一样，开心地游来游去。在水中重量是不重要的，艾伦第一次真正感到了自由：可以自己行动的自由。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Here I am!" she yelled, laughing.<br>
            The servant tried to get her, but she swam away. For hours, she swam around the lake like a swan. In the water gravity didn't matter. For the first time, Ellen felt truly free to move on her own.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            从那以后，艾伦只想着游泳。夏天，她会在湖里玩儿一整天；冬天，她会让仆人们敲碎湖面的冰。每到晚上，艾伦就会看着窗外，想念着她的湖。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After this event all Ellen wanted to do was swim. In the summer she swam all day long. In the winter servants broke the ice for her. At night she stared out her bedroom window, missing the lake.

            哲学家们仔细观察着艾伦。很快，他们就有了同样的想法。<br>

            “必须是眼泪！”&nbsp;哈姆抢着说道，“我们必须让公主哭才行！”&nbsp;

            国王敲了敲扶手，看向王后：“我们要怎么让艾伦哭呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “那是不可能的！”&nbsp;王后叹了口气，“她只会笑！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king drummed his fingers on the armrest, looking at the queen. "How can we make Ellen cry?" <br>
            "It's impossible." The queen sighed. "All she does is laugh!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是，王后很快有了一个主意。<br>
            第二天，一个乞丐来到了王宫。他穿着破烂的衣服，脸上全是泥土，脏兮兮的。仆人领着艾伦过来了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the queen soon came up with another idea. <br>
            The next day a beggar arrived at the palace. His clothes were rags. His face was streaked with dirt. A servant led Ellen into the room.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你找我吗，爸爸？”&nbsp;艾伦问国王。<br>
            国王向艾伦介绍乞丐。<br>
            “这个人的生活非常可怜，现在来听一听他的故事吧。”&nbsp;国王转向乞丐，“请告诉我们你最悲伤的故事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes, Papa?" Ellen said.<br>
            The king introduced the beggar. <br>
            "This man has had a hard life. He would like to tell you some stories." The king turned to the beggar. "Please tell us your saddest tales."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            接下来，这个乞丐告诉了艾伦他有多么可怜：“每天晚上都饿着肚子睡觉，躺在冰冷的地上，又饿又冷。有时候几天只吃了一点儿面包屑。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For the next hour, the beggar told Ellen about being poor. "Every night I go to bed hungry. I sleep in the cold. Some days I eat only a few crumbs."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后流下了眼泪：“太可怜了！”&nbsp;她看了一眼女儿。艾伦低着头，她的胸口发出了什么声音。<br>
            王后的眼睛亮了！“我的方法有效果了！”&nbsp;她想，“公主终于要哭了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Tears fell from the queen's eyes. "How sad!" She glanced at her daughter. Ellen was looking down. A sound was bubbling up from her chest.<br>
            The queen's face lit up. "My idea is working!" she thought. "The princess is sobbing!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是，艾伦发出的声音不是哭声，而是笑声！过了一会儿，公主再也忍不住了，她开始哈哈大笑。国王和王后很头疼，让仆人把公主带走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the sound bursting from Ellen was not a sob. It was a giggle. A second later the princess was screaming with laughter. The king and queen groaned as a servant took her away.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们该怎么办？”&nbsp;国王问道。<br>
            第二天，国王和王后又尝试了其他方法：他们上楼来到公主的卧室。然后他们用最凶的态度、最难听的话骂了公主。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What will we do?" the king asked.<br>
            The next day the king and queen tried something else: they marched upstairs to the princess' bedroom. Then they yelled at her fiercely with the meanest words.

    </div>
    <div>

            公主的嘴唇开始颤抖，然后……<br>
            她又大笑起来。<br>
            在这个时候，有一位英俊的王子正在为自己寻找妻子。王子勇敢善良，有很多女孩儿喜欢他，但是王子都不喜欢。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess' lip quivered. And then . . . <br>
            She burst into laughter.<br>
            Now, around this time, a handsome prince was looking for a wife. The prince was brave and kind, and many women loved him. Yet the prince didn't love any of them back.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “可能我要去其他王国找找了。”&nbsp;他最后决定，“也许我能在那里找到适合我的妻子，一个能让我开心快乐的妻子。”&nbsp;<br>
            一天下午，他骑着马来到一个湖边。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Maybe I should go to another kingdom to look for her," he decided at last. "Perhaps I can find the right princess there. I want a wife who makes me laugh and feel happy." <br>
            One afternoon he was riding along a lake.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “多么美丽的湖哇！”&nbsp;王子心想。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;有人在尖叫。<br>
            王子跳下马，跑到湖边。他看到湖中心有一个女孩儿快要淹死了！

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What a lovely lake!" the prince thought.<br>

            "I'll save you!" The prince cried, diving into the water.<br>

            She dropped down to the ground and stomped over to the prince.<br>

            "Why did you pull me out of the water?" Ellen asked.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I thought you were drowning," the prince said.<br>

            "It's her!" the prince thought. People told stories about a light princess with no gravity. This must be the princess! <br>

            王子终于明白了。对于没有重量的公主来说，她自己是没办法回到湖里的。

            At last the prince understood. Without gravity, the princess could not put herself back in the water.

            Then one day at the lake, Agnes saw Ellen swimming. The princess dived and floated, laughing with delight.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Back at home, the angry witch paced back and forth. "I'll cast a new spell, a better one," she thought. "Ellen will lose her beloved lake. And the kingdom will lose all its water!"

            艾格尼丝急忙走到一个箱子前，她取出了一些干海草，然后把海草放进一桶漂满药粉的水里。她一边念着咒语一边搅拌药水。<br>

            Agnes hurried to a chest for some dried seaweed. She threw it into a tub of water filled with powder. Chanting a spell, she began to stir.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Perfect!" The witch put the water dragon on her shoulders. "Now I must get the keys to all the cellars."<br>
            Agnes grabbed a huge key ring with a hundred keys. Then she went to a cellar door and unlocked it. She went down a few steps and came to another door.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她打开门，然后又下了几个台阶，来到另一个门前……就这样，一直到100个门全部打开。走下最后的台阶，这里是一个巨大的洞穴！一根根石柱支撑着顶部。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She unlocked that one, climbing down more steps to another door. She kept doing this until one hundred doors were unlocked. At the bottom of all the steps was a huge cave! Its ceiling was held up by rock pillars.

            女巫抬头看向洞顶，嘎嘎笑了起来。洞顶的上面就是湖底！<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Gazing at the ceiling, the witch cackled. Above it was the bottom of the lake!<br>
            Agnes lifted the water dragon. The water dragon stretched upward and kept looking for something on the ceiling.

            水龙紧紧地吸在那块石头上。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly it darted toward a stone.<br>
            "You found it!" the witch said. "Drain the lake dry, my baby!" <br>
            The dragon latched onto the stone tightly.

            艾格尼斯松开手，让水龙吊在空中。然后她坐了下来，开始织毛衣。她的黑猫走过来躺在她的脚边。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Agnes let go, and left the dragon hanging. Then she sat down and began to knit. Her black cat came and lay down beside her legs.<br>

            朋友们，我们的公主现在全心全意地爱着这片湖。她知道最好的跳水地点在哪里，她知道最高的河岸在哪里，她还知道各种鱼和动物都生活在哪里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            My friends, the princess loved the lake with all her heart. She knew where to find its best diving spots. She knew where its tallest banks sat. She knew where all its fish and wild creatures lived.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所以，艾伦马上就感觉到了湖在变化。她第一次有感觉是在和王子一起游泳的时候。<br>
            她快速浮出水面，看了看四周：“湖有问题！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So Ellen knew at once that the lake was changing. She first noticed it while swimming with the prince.  <br>
            She shot to the surface and looked around. "Something's wrong with the lake!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王子也跟着她浮出水面：“没什么问题呀。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不！湖不一样了！”&nbsp;艾伦开始向湖的更深处游去。<br>
            王子跟在她身后，想知道她是不是病了：“艾伦，你没事吧？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The prince popped up nearby. "It looks fine to me."<br>
            "No, the lake is different!" She took off, swimming toward a deeper part of the lake.<br>
            He swam after her, wondering if she was sick. "Ellen! Are you okay?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾伦没有回答他，也没有回头。她从一个地方游到另一个地方，仔细检查着这片湖。<br>
            第二天他们见面时，艾伦非常伤心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Ellen didn't reply or look back. She darted from place to place, checking different spots around the lake. <br>
            The next day when they met, she was very upset.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “湖岸太干了，草和植物都快死了。”&nbsp;艾伦指着岩石，“看那些岩石！它们以前是在水下的。”&nbsp;<br>
            困惑的王子想要安慰她，但是被艾伦推开了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The banks are too dry. The grass and plants are dying." She pointed to some rocks. "Look at those rocks! They are usually under the water."<br>
            The confused prince tried to comfort her. But she pushed him away.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这太可怕了！”&nbsp;艾伦喊道，“湖水正在流失！”&nbsp;<br>
            艾格尼丝在洞穴里待了七天七夜。终于，水龙掉到了地上，它很快就干了，又变回了海草。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This is terrible," she cried. "The lake is losing its water!" <br>
            Agnes stayed in the cellar for seven days and seven nights. Finally the water dragon dropped onto the floor. It quickly dried up and turned back to seaweed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾格尼丝捡起海草，她抬起头，发现水开始从石头上滴下来。<br>
            “咒语起作用了！”&nbsp;她大喊。湖水很快就会涌入洞穴，她必须回到楼上……要快！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The witch grabbed the seaweed and looked up. Water was beginning to drip from the stone.<br>
            "The spell worked!" she cried. Soon lake water would be rushing into her cellars. She had to get back upstairs—fast!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            第二天，艾格尼丝来到湖边。湖里几乎已经没有水了，但湖底还有一些浅浅的水坑。<br>
            艾格尼丝皱起眉头：“咒语花的时间太长了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day Agnes checked the lake. Most of its water was gone. But here and there were a few shallow pools. <br>
            Agnes frowned. "The spell is taking too long!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天晚上，艾格尼丝又回到湖边，给每个地方都洒了魔法药水。然后她又去了王宫和公主的窗前。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            That night Agnes went back to the lake. She sprinkled her potion everywhere. Then she went to the front of the princess’ window at the palace.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，王国里的河流都停止了流动，没有水再从山上流下来，喷泉和水井都干了，就连婴儿的眼泪也干了。<br>
            终于，湖里最后的一点儿水也消失了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            An instant later the kingdom's rivers and brooks stopped flowing. Water no longer rushed down its mountains. Fountains and wells went dry. Even babies' tears dried up. <br>
            At the lake the last bit of water was finally gone.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess closed her bedroom curtains. She was very sad. All that was left in the lake was mud and rocks, and some fishes flopping in the muck.

            She forgot about everyone, even her parents. The palace no longer rang with the sound of her laughter. <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ellen is never coming back," he thought. "I must find out if she's okay."<br>

            While he shined boots, he asked other servants about Ellen. They all said the same thing: "The princess is dying."  <br>

            "I'll go away to think of a plan," he decided.

            王子又穿上仆人的衣服，然后急忙向王宫走去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Great! Finally there is something I can do!" he thought. "I'll lose my life. But without the princess, I have no life. And I will see her one last time before I die."<br>
            The prince dressed like a servant again. Then he hurried to the palace.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王盯着面前这个英俊的仆人：“告诉我你想要什么，年轻人？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我想当软木塞。”&nbsp;王子说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king stared at the handsome servant before him. "Tell me what you want, young man."<br>
            "I want to be the cork," the prince said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王惊讶得站了起来：“什么？你愿意当英雄吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的！我愿意献出我的生命，让湖水重新回来。”&nbsp;王子说。<br>
            “太棒了！”&nbsp;国王说，“那要不要先去看看你的父母？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king gasped. "What? You'll be the hero?"<br>
            "Yes. I will give my life to return water to the lake," the prince said.<br>
            "That's wonderful!" the king said. "Would you like to go and see your parents first?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不用了。”&nbsp;王子说，“但我有一个条件。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么都行！”&nbsp;国王说道。<br>
            “我会爬进洞里，”&nbsp;王子开始说，“然后，水会慢慢回到湖里，当水超过我的头时，我就会被淹死。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No," the prince said. "But I do have one condition." <br>
            "Anything!" the king said. <br>
            "I'll climb into the hole," the prince began. "Then, by magic, water will return to the lake. When it reaches my head, I will drown."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王低下头：“恐怕是的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这个过程需要很长时间。”&nbsp;王子继续说道。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;国王咬着嘴唇，“等待是最难的。但是如果你愿意当软木塞，湖水就再也不会流失了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king looked down. "I'm afraid so, yes."<br>
            "It will be a long wait," the prince went on. <br>
            "Yes." The king bit his lip. "Waiting is hard. But with you as cork, the lake will never leak again."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望公主能陪着我。”&nbsp;王子接着说，“喂我吃东西、陪我聊聊天，安慰安慰我。等水到我的眼睛时，公主就可以离开了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I want the princess to sit with me," the prince went on. "She can feed me, chat with me, and comfort me. When the water reaches my eyes, she may go."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我答应你的条件！”&nbsp;国王说，“现在就去准备吧！我的侍卫们会去寻找那个洞的。”&nbsp;<br>
            侍卫们花了很长时间找啊找。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I will grant your condition," the king said. "Now go and prepare yourself. My guards will search for the hole."<br>
            It took the guards a long time to find the hole.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，他们终于在湖底的中心，找到了那个在巨石中的洞。<br>
            侍卫们急忙回去告诉国王。<br>
            是时候拯救湖水和公主了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But they finally found it in the center of the lake bed. It was in the middle of a large stone. <br>
            The guards hurried back to tell the king. It was time to save the lake and the princess.<br>

            国王和王后把这个消息告诉了艾伦：一个男人，一个勇敢的英雄，愿意为她而死！<br>
            艾伦高兴得从床上跳了下来：“快带我去湖边！”&nbsp;<br>
            仆人们把艾伦抱到湖底的中心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Ellen's parents told her the news. A man—a brave hero—was willing to die for her. <br>
            She jumped off her bed in joy. "Carry me to the lake!" <br>
            Servants carried Ellen to the middle of the lake bed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一只小船停在淤泥里，里面装满了食物和其他东西。<br>
            王子向艾伦挥手：“我在这儿！”&nbsp;<br>
            在咒语的作用下，艾伦只是眨了眨眼睛，“我好像认识他。”&nbsp;艾伦心想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A small boat was waiting there in the mud. It was filled with food and other supplies. <br>
            The prince arrived, waving. "Here I am!"<br>
            Still under the witch's spell, Ellen blinked. "I know him," Ellen thought.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王子爬进洞里。神奇的事情发生了！石头里开始有水流了出来。<br>
            “起作用了！”&nbsp;王子心想，“湖水要重新回来了。”&nbsp;<br>
            艾伦让其他人离开，然后她躺下来，闭上眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The prince climbed into the hole. Water magically began flowing over the stone. <br>
            "It's working," he thought. "The lake is filling up again." <br>
            Ellen told the others to leave. She lay in the boat with her eyes shut.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “有你在真好！”&nbsp;艾伦对王子说。<br>
            “和你在一起，我也很开心。”&nbsp;王子说道，“那时候的我们总是大声地笑着。”&nbsp;<br>
            时间一点点过去，石头上的水流慢慢起了波浪。随着湖水的上涨，小船浮了起来，而公主已经睡着了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It is great to have you here," she said to the prince.<br>
            "You made me happy," the prince said. "We laughed all the time."<br>
            Time went by, and waves began flowing over the stone. As the water rose, the boat began to float. <br>
            The princess fell asleep.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “艾伦！”&nbsp;王子很难过，“你的爸爸答应过我，你会安慰我的！”&nbsp;<br>
            艾伦打了个哈欠：“我太困了。”&nbsp;<br>
            王子叹了口气：“那你睡吧，亲爱的。不用担心我。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ellen!" The prince was hurt. "Your father promised that you would comfort me!" <br>
            She yawned. "I'm too sleepy."<br>
            The prince sighed. "Sleep then, darling. Don't worry about me."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “有你在真好！”&nbsp;艾伦说，“谢谢你！不过我要继续睡觉了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你能先给我一点食物吗？”&nbsp;王子问道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It is great to have you here!" she said. "Thank you. I think I will go back to sleep."<br>
            "Can you give me some food first?" the prince asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾伦拿到食物，然后第一次仔细地看了看王子的脸：“你看起来不太好。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我很好，”&nbsp;王子说，“我只是需要吃一点东西。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Reaching for the food, she looked at him for the first time. "You don't look very well."<br>
            "I'm fine," he said. "I just need to eat."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公主给王子喂了一些食物。不久，太阳下山了，月亮从湖面上升了起来。这时，水已经涨到了王子的腰部。<br>
            “现在有很多水了，”&nbsp;艾伦说，“我们去游泳吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess fed him. Soon the sun went down, and the moon rose over the lake. By now waters were gushing around the prince's waist.<br>
            "There's plenty of water now," Ellen said. "Let's go swimming!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王子摇了摇头，悲伤地说：“恐怕我再也没办法游泳了。”&nbsp;<br>
            艾伦笑了：“我真傻，我忘了！”&nbsp;<br>
            湖水不断上涨，一直涨到了王子的脖子。王子觉得很累，他知道他快要死了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The prince shook his head. "I'm afraid I've had my last swim," he said sadly. <br>
            Ellen laughed. "Silly me. I forgot!" <br>
            The water kept rising, reaching his neck. The prince felt weak. He knew the end was near.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我亲爱的公主，你可以吻我一下吗？”&nbsp;王子问道，“这样我就能幸福地死去了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “当然！”&nbsp;艾伦俯身慢慢靠近王子的脸。突然！她想起来了：这是她的王子！但是王子快要死了！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Will you kiss me, princess?" he asked. "Then I can die happy."<br>
            "Of course." As she leaned forward, the princess stared at the man's face. And finally it struck her. This was her prince. And he was dying!

            艾伦跳进水里，她用力拉了拉王子的肩膀，但是没有用。她浮出水面换了口气。怎么办？水已经涨到王子的眼睛了！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princess jumped into the lake. Underwater, she grabbed the prince's shoulders But it didn’t work. She came up for air. What could she do? The water was up to the prince's eyes!

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾伦把王子的头往后仰，这样他的鼻子和嘴就能露出水面了。<br>
            “啊！他没有呼吸了！”&nbsp;艾伦非常惊慌，“我该怎么办？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Ellen tilted his head back. His nose and mouth were above the surface now.<br>
            "But he's not breathing!" she thought in a panic. "What should I do?"
        </div>
    </div>

            突然，“爱”&nbsp;和“水”&nbsp;给了艾伦巨大的勇气。她再一次潜入水中，用所有的力气抓着王子往上拉。终于，王子的一只手臂从洞里出来了，他的身体也很快跟着出来了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly "love" and "water" brought back all her strength. She dived in again and pulled with her whole might. Finally, an arm came out of the hole. The rest of his body quickly followed.

            朋友们，没有人知道公主是怎么把王子弄上船的。但不管怎么样，公主做到了！然后，她用最快的速度把船划到岸边。<br>
            她再次用全身的力气，把王子拖到了岸上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            My friends, no one knows how the princess got him into the boat. But somehow she did this. Then she rowed the boat to shore as fast as she could. <br>
            Using all her strength again, she pulled the prince onto land.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王子脸色苍白，双眼紧紧地闭着。<br>
            “太迟了。”&nbsp;艾伦心想，“他死了！”&nbsp;<br>
            艾伦的心很痛。她的身体发出了奇怪的声音，眼中充满了……泪水！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            His cheeks were pale, and his eyes were closed. <br>
            "I'm too late," she thought. "He's dead!" <br>
            Ellen's chest felt tight. She let out a strange sound, and her eyes filled with . . . tears!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            人生第一次，艾伦哭了！她哭的时候，天空也开始下雨了。不过这不是普通的雨，而是像红宝石、蓝宝石、绿宝石那样彩色的雨！<br>
            雨越下越大。很快，金色的水从山上流了下来，河流又开始流动起来，婴儿的眼里也有了小小的泪花。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For the first time ever in her life, Ellen cried! When she cried, raindrops began to fall. And it wasn't an ordinary rain. It was the colors of rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. <br>
            The rain grew stronger. Soon water flowed down mountains like liquid gold. Brooks and rivers streamed again. Babies' eyes filled with tiny tears.

            湖水越涨越高。同时，艾格尼丝地下室里的水也越涨越高！<br>
            咣！汹涌的湖水冲破了地下室的门，涌上台阶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The water in the lake rose higher and higher. So did the water in Agnes' cellars. <br>
            Crash! A powerful river suddenly burst through the cellars' doors and passages.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦！不！”&nbsp;艾格尼丝尖叫起来。强大的水流带走了她。<br>
            艾伦一直在哭，她哭得很伤心，没有看到王子睁开了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh no!" Agnes screamed. The churning flood water swept her away.<br>
            The princess continued to cry. She cried so hard, she didn't see the prince open his eyes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你在为我哭泣吗？”&nbsp;王子问道。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Are you crying for me?" he asked. <br>
            "You're alive!" The princess leaped up. But she didn't float away. Instead she tumbled back down onto the ground!

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你摔在地上了！”&nbsp;王子很惊讶，“也就是说……你有重量了！”&nbsp;<br>
            王国里的每个人都非常开心。很快，艾伦和王子就结婚了。他们生了很多孩子。当然！每个孩子都有重量。<br>
            从此，他们幸福地生活在一起。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You fell!" The prince was amazed. "That means . . . You have gravity!" <br>
            Everyone in the kingdom rejoiced. Soon afterward Ellen and the prince got married. They had many children. And of course, every child had gravity.<br>
            Together they lived happily ever after.
