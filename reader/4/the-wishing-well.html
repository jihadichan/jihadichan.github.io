            搬一次家可真不容易。从芝加哥这样的大城市搬到一个小山村就更不容易了。我们来问问巴斯家的孩子们吧。<br>
            “这里没什么好玩的！”&nbsp;名叫赛伊的老大抱怨道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Moving is never easy. Moving from a big city like Chicago to a small town is even harder. Just ask the Barth children. <br>
            "There's nothing to do here!" complained the oldest, named Cy.
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这里什么商店都没有。”&nbsp;老二安西娅也在抱怨。她的兄弟姐妹亲切地叫她潘瑟。那时，她的弟弟鲍比年纪很小。他还不会叫安西娅，所以他就叫她潘瑟。现在其他几个兄弟姐妹也这么叫她了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't see any shops," whined Anthea, the second eldest. Among her siblings, her nickname was Panther. When her younger brother, Bobby, was little, he couldn't say Anthea. He called her Panther instead, and now the others did too.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “您这是什么意思？我们不能上网？”&nbsp;鲍比哭着说。<br>
            “咦！那是什么？”&nbsp;简尖叫道。一只棕色的小田鼠从台阶下迅速跑出来，冲进了草从里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What do you mean, we won't have Internet?" cried Bobby, looking up at his father. <br>
            "Eeek! What's that?" Jane screamed. A little brown field mouse scurried from under the steps and into the grass.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            没有一个人想要搬到玛莎阿姨的家里，但爸爸丢掉了工作，他们没有其他的选择了。<br>
            孩子们坐在餐桌边妈妈尽力安慰他们说：“我们就在这里小住几天。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这里有很多事情可以做。”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            No one in the family had wanted to move to Aunt Martha's house. But Father had lost his job, and they had no choice. "It's only for a short while," Mother said, trying to comfort the children as they sat at the kitchen table. <br>
            "And there're lots of things to do around here," said Aunt Martha.
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对啊，比如抓蚱蜢?”&nbsp;赛伊没好气的说。<br>
            “蚱蜢？哪里？”&nbsp;简尖叫道。<br>
            更糟糕的是，妈妈和爸爸第二天一早就离开了。爸爸要去芝加哥参加几个工作面试。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yeah, like catch grasshoppers?" Cy said in a rather nasty way. <br>
            "Grasshoppers? Where?" screamed Jane. <br>
            To make matters worse, Mother and Father left the next morning. Father had some job interviews in Chicago.

            孩子们孤孤单单地站在台阶上，看着小汽车慢慢开走了。<br>
            “咩，咩。”&nbsp;小婴儿开心地大叫。<br>
            “哦，兰姆。没什么事情能让你觉得伤心，对不对？”&nbsp;潘瑟笑着说。小婴儿希拉里会有这个昵称是因为它说的第一个词是“咩”&nbsp;，就像小羊羔一样。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children stood alone on the steps as the car pulled away. <br>
            "Baa, baa," cried the baby happily. <br>
            "Oh, Lamb. Nothing makes you sad, does it?" Panther laughed. Hilary, the baby, got his nickname because the first word he said was "baa," just like a little lamb.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们不想回到房子里。那里什么也没得玩儿。玛莎阿姨家后面是一片茂密的森林。因为没人有更好的主意了，于是他们就出发去森林里探险了。<br>
            “看！”&nbsp;鲍比激动地指着一大群浣熊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children didn't want to go back inside the house. There was nothing to do there. Behind Aunt Martha's house was a thick forest. And since no one had a better idea, they set off to explore the woods. <br>
            "Look!" Bobby pointed excitedly at a family of raccoons.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “闻闻！”&nbsp;潘瑟一边说一边弯下腰去闻这些美丽的花朵。<br>
            一整天，孩子们都在森林里搜索新的发现。过了一会儿，他们发现自己身在茂密的丛林中。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Smell these!" Panther said, as she bent over some colorful flowers. <br>
            All day, the children searched the forest for new discoveries. After a while, they found themselves in a thicket of trees.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这里黑的好可怕。”&nbsp;潘瑟有点儿担心地说。<br>
            “或者我们应该回去了。”&nbsp;简补充道。<br>
            “嘿！看这个！”&nbsp;赛伊激动地大叫。赛伊发现了一口古老的枯井。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's awfully dark in here," Panther said in a worried voice. <br>
            "Maybe we should go back," Jane added. <br>
            "Hey! Look at this!" Cy called out excitedly. Cy had found an old, dried-up well.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你能看到什么东西吗？”&nbsp;简问。所有人都弯腰向井里看去。<br>
            “没有！但是我感觉这里面会很有趣。”&nbsp;赛伊回答说。<br>
            “里面有水吗？”&nbsp;鲍比问道。<br>
            孩子们盯着井里更深的地方，他们的眼睛越睁越大。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can you see anything?" asked Jane, as they all peered down the well. <br>
            "Nope! But there's a funny smell," replied Cy. <br>
            "Is there any water?" Bobby asked. <br>
            The children stared deeper into the well, their eyes getting wider.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我在想这会不会是一个许愿井。”&nbsp;简说。<br>
            “等等！看这里。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。潘瑟在枯井的旁边发现了一个破旧的木桶系在绳子上。“我们把这个桶放到井里去，看看那下面有什么吧。<br>
            ”&nbsp;她说。“她在干嘛？”&nbsp;鲍比指着简说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wonder if this is a wishing well," said Jane.<br>
            "Wait! Look here," said Panther. Next to the well, Panther had found an old wooden bucket attached to some rope. "Let's lower this bucket and see what's down there," she said. <br>
            "What's she doing?" Bobby said, pointing to Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            简闭上了眼睛，拿着一枚硬币。“我在许愿。”&nbsp;她回答说。她转身将硬币越过肩膀扔进了井里。叮当！叮当！叮当！<br>
            “哎呦！”&nbsp;井里传出一声大叫。<br>
            “你们听见了吗？”&nbsp;鲍比小声说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Jane's eyes were closed, and she was holding onto a coin. "I'm making a wish," she replied. She turned around and threw the coin over her shoulder and into the well. Clink, clink, clonk.<br>
            "Ouch!" a voice cried from the well. <br>
            "Did you hear that?" whispered Bobby.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你好，下面的！”&nbsp;赛伊大声叫道。“你好，下面的！”&nbsp;他的声音在井里回荡着。然后一切都安静了。<br>
            “我肯定我听到了的声音。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “你觉得那是动物吗？”&nbsp;简担心地问。<br>
            “要找到答案就只有一个方法。”&nbsp;赛伊激动地说。他将桶向下放到了井里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello, down there!" Cy shouted. "Hello, down there!" his voice echoed inside the well. Then silence. <br>
            "I'm sure I heard something," said Bobby. <br>
            "Do you think it's an animal?" Jane asked worriedly. <br>
            "There's only one way to find out," Cy said excitedly. He lowered the bucket down the well.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你能感觉到什么吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟问。<br>
            “快点，你能感觉到什么吗？”&nbsp;鲍比耐不住性子地说。<br>
            赛伊将桶拉了回来。桶里满是泥巴、汽水罐、旧鞋子，还有一些石头。赛伊又将木桶放到井底好几次。如果井里有什么东西，他下定决心一定要把它找出来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can you feel anything?" Panther asked. <br>
            "Hurry up, will you?" Bobby said impatiently. <br>
            Cy pulled the bucket back up. It was full of mud, soda cans, an old shoe, and some rocks. Cy lowered the bucket again several times. If there was something in the well, he was determined to find it.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一次又一次地把木桶放下去，赛伊觉得有些烦了。其他人也想要放弃了。赛伊深深地吐了一口气。“就这样吧。井里没什么特别的东西。”&nbsp;他一边说一边将最后一桶东西倒出来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After a while, Cy got tired of lowering the bucket. The others wanted to give up too. Cy let out a deep breath. "That's it. There's nothing else down there," he said, emptying a final bucket load.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “等等。”&nbsp;潘瑟叫道，“看这个！”&nbsp;她捡起了一块外形奇特的贝壳儿，上面有很多泥浆。<br>
            “这是什么？”&nbsp;简问。她凑近了去看那个东西。<br>
            潘瑟抹去了一些泥浆，把它拿在手里。它很美。“我觉得这是个贝壳。”&nbsp;她回答说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wait," cried Panther. "Look at this!" She picked out an unusual shell, covered in mud. <br>
            "What is it?" Jane asked, looking closer. <br>
            Panther wiped off some of the mud and held it up. It was beautiful. "I think it's a seashell," she replied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她开始抹去余下的泥浆。突然，那个贝壳开始咯咯笑。潘瑟吓了一大跳，差点儿扔了它。<br>
            “它笑了！”&nbsp;鲍比大叫道。<br>
            “里面有东西。”&nbsp;他在壳状物上敲了敲。<br>
            “噢！别这样！”&nbsp;壳状物叫道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She began wiping off the rest of the mud. Suddenly, the shell began to giggle. Panther was so shocked, she almost dropped it. <br>
            "It laughed!" Bobby shouted loudly. "Something's inside." He knocked on the shell. <br>
            "Ouch! Stop that!" the shell cried.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们都你看看我我看看你。然后，最奇妙的事情发生了。一个生物从壳子里探出头来。它有着海马的脸。它的脖子和背上有不断开合的闪闪发光的鳍。当它的脑袋左右转动时，那对儿鳍也闪闪发光。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children all looked at each other. Then the most amazing thing happened. A creature poked its head out from the shell. It had the face of a seahorse. On its neck and back were shimmery fins that opened and closed. As its head circled left and right, the fins glowed and shone.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们第一次遇到这种奇事，都愣住了。<br>
            “好了？”&nbsp;那个生物生气地问道。<br>
            最后，潘瑟开口了：“你是什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            那个生物盯着他们。“那我就告诉你们。”&nbsp;它开始说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For the first time in their lives, the children were speechless. <br>
            "Well?" the creature asked in an irritated voice. <br>
            Finally, Panther spoke up. "What are you?" <br>
            The creature gazed at them. "Let me get this straight," it began.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们朝我扔东西，把我吵醒了。”&nbsp;它盯着简。“是你一开始拿走我的东西。”&nbsp;它看着赛伊。“你挠我痒痒。”&nbsp;它瞪着潘瑟。“然后，你在我的壳上敲来敲去！”&nbsp;鲍比低头看着地面。“现在，你们告诉我说你们连我是谁都不知道？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You throw things on me and wake me up." It glared at Jane. "You start taking away my things." It looked at Cy. "You tickle me." It stared at Panther. "Then you bang on my shell!" Bobby looked down at the ground. "And now, you tell me that you don't even know what I am?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们尴尬地盯着地面。“真对不起！”&nbsp;简抱歉地说。“我们不知道你在井里。”&nbsp;<br>
            那个生物什么都没说。过了一会，它的鳍不再闪光了。“我接受你们的道歉。”&nbsp;最后它说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children stared at the ground in embarrassment. "We're sorry," apologized Jane. "We didn't know you were in the well." <br>
            The creature didn't say anything. After a while, its fins stopped glowing. "Apology accepted," it said finally.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但我们真的不知道你是谁。”&nbsp;赛伊迅速补充说。<br>
            “我是奥伦八世，”&nbsp;它郑重地说，“我是我们种族在整个海洋里的第八代。”&nbsp;<br>
            “哇。”&nbsp;孩子们齐声叫出来。<br>
            “不过你们可以叫我休伊。”&nbsp;那个生物笑了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But we really don't know what you are," Cy added quickly. <br>
            "I am Huit des Orlanes," it announced. "The eighth of my kind of the sea." <br>
            "Wow," the children said in unison. <br>
            "But you can call me Huey," the creature smiled.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们的脸上还是一片茫然，显然他们还是不知道他到底是谁。“你们知道什么是奥伦吗？”&nbsp;他问。<br>
            “实际上不知道。”&nbsp;简替所有人回答了。<br>
            休伊猛地闭上了眼睛。他的脑袋快速地左右转动着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was clear from the children's blank faces that they still did not know what he was. "Do you know what an Orlane is?" he asked. <br>
            "Not really," Jane admitted for them all. <br>
            Huey closed his eyes dramatically. His head turned quickly from side to side.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “从前，”&nbsp;他说，“我们奥伦是海洋里最有名的神秘生物。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你是说，你是个妖精？”&nbsp;鲍比打断了他的话。<br>
            “妖精？噢，我的天，哦，我的天哪！”&nbsp;休伊的鳍又开始一边发光一边不断快速地扇动着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "At one time," he said, "we, Orlanes, were the best-known mystic creatures of the sea." <br>
            "You mean, you're a fairy?" interrupted Bobby. <br>
            "A fairy? Oh, my, oh, my!" Huey's fins started to glow again as they opened and closed quickly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “请不要生气，休伊。”&nbsp;简说，“鲍比的意思并不是要把你叫成妖精。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那好吧。”&nbsp;休伊平静地说。“奥伦拥有天赐的能力，可以让其他人实现任何愿望。”&nbsp;他继续说。<br>
            “你是说，你可以让愿望成真？”&nbsp;鲍比问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Please don't be upset, Huey," said Jane. "Bobby didn't mean to call you a fairy." <br>
            "All right then," Huey said calmly. "Orlanes have the gift to grant others whatever they want," he continued. <br>
            "You mean you can make wishes come true?" Bobby asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            休伊点点头，然后其他孩子就和鲍比一起开心地大叫起来。<br>
            “但是，”&nbsp;休伊提高声音道，“你们必须保证两件事。”&nbsp;<br>
            “只要能实现愿望，我们任何事情都愿意做！”&nbsp;简拍手道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Huey nodded, and the other children joined Bobby in shouts of delight. <br>
            "However," Huey said in a loud voice. "There are two things you must promise." <br>
            "We'll do anything to get our wish!" Jane clapped her hands.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            休伊继续说下去。“首先，”&nbsp;他说，“你们一天只可以许一个愿望。第二，在许下愿望之后，你们必须将我送回井里。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这听起来并不是很难。”&nbsp;赛伊笑着说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Huey continued. "First," he said, "you can only make one wish a day. And second, after making your wish, you must return me to the well." <br>
            "That doesn't sound too hard." Cy laughed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “还有，”&nbsp;休伊笑了，“日落的时候，一切都会恢复到原来的样子。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你是说，我们的愿望只能实现一天？”&nbsp;鲍比用失望的语气问。<br>
            “是的！”&nbsp;休伊回答之后就消失在了他的壳里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "By the way," Huey smiled, "at sunset, everything returns to the way it was." <br>
            "You mean, our wish is true only for one day?" asked Bobby in a disappointed voice. <br>
            "Yes," Huey replied, and with that, he disappeared back into his shell.

            第二天早上，孩子们吃早饭的速度特别快。一想到能再次见到休伊，大家都很兴奋。<br>
            “哪儿着火了？”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨问。<br>
            赛伊给大家使了个眼色。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, the children could hardly eat their breakfast fast enough. They were excited about visiting Huey again. <br>
            "Where's the fire?" Aunt Martha asked. <br>
            Cy gave his siblings a warning look.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们都保证过不会向任何人提起休伊。“我们今天只是去树林里转转。”&nbsp;鲍比说。他的嘴里塞满了煎饼。<br>
            前一天，赛伊按照休伊的要求将它送回了井底。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They had promised not to speak about Huey to anyone. "We're just going out to the woods today," Bobby said, his mouth full of pancake. <br>
            The previous day, Cy had lowered Huey back down the well, just as Huey had asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比非常聪明，他在通往那口井的小路上做了标记。但他们找那条小路找了很久，却还是在原地打转。<br>
            “你确定是这条路吗，鲍比？”&nbsp;简嘀咕道。<br>
            “你用什么做标记的？”&nbsp;潘瑟问。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And Bobby had cleverly marked the trail that led to the well. But after searching for the trail for a while, they seemed to be going in circles. <br>
            "Are you sure it's this way, Bobby?" Jane whined. <br>
            "What did you use to mark the trail?" asked Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “花生啊。”&nbsp;鲍比回答。遗憾的是，鲍比用来在小路上做标记的那些花生都被浣熊一家子吃光了。<br>
            “很好！我们永远也找不到小路了！”&nbsp;赛伊大叫。<br>
            孩子们迷茫地看看四周。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Peanuts," replied Bobby. Unfortunately for the children, a family of raccoons had eaten Bobby's trail markers. <br>
            "Just great! We'll never find the trail!" cried Cy. <br>
            The children looked around in confusion.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “走这条路试试吧！”&nbsp;潘瑟说。他们向她说的方向走去。几个小时过去了，但他们依然连那口井的影子都没看到。<br>
            “我们迷路了。我们现在永远都不会找到休伊了。”&nbsp;简抱怨说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let's try this path," Panther said. They headed off in the direction she pointed. Hours passed, but there was still no sign of the well. <br>
            "We're lost. We'll never find Huey now," complained Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “等等！那边是什么？”&nbsp;赛伊指着某个地方，他激动地跳了起来。“看！我们找到那口井了！”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们跑向了那口井。赛伊迅速将木桶放到了井底并把那个贝壳拉了上来。<br>
            “休伊！休伊！”&nbsp;他们一起叫道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wait! What's that over there?" cried Cy, pointing and jumping up and down. "Look! We found the well!" <br>
            The children raced to the well. Cy quickly lowered the bucket and pulled up the shell. "Huey, Huey," they called together.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            休伊慢慢从他的壳里探出了脑袋。<br>
            “哦，又是你们！”&nbsp;他迷迷糊糊地说，“我还在希望遇见你们不过是个糟糕的梦而已。”&nbsp;<br>
            潘瑟决定友好地问一些事情：“休伊，你怎么会在这个井里呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Huey's head slowly peeked out of his shell. "Oh, it's you again," he said sleepily. "I was hoping that meeting you had been just a bad dream." <br>
            Panther decided to ask something friendly: "Huey, how did you end up in this well?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这对你们来说可能就是一口老井，”&nbsp;休伊说，“但这口井对我们这样的海洋生物来说却是一个旅行站。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你要去哪里？”&nbsp;简问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It may look like just an old well to you," Huey said. "But this well is also a traveling station for sea creatures like me." <br>
            "Where are you going?" asked Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要去马维斯提见我的兄弟们。这口井不过是个临时停留的地方。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的意思是，你要离开？”&nbsp;鲍比哀叹道，“什么时候？”&nbsp;<br>
            “时间到了的时候。”&nbsp;休伊肯定地回答，“现在，你们想好了愿望没有？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I am journeying to Marvesti to meet my brothers. This well is only a temporary stop." <br>
            "You mean, you're going to leave?" Bobby wailed. "When?" <br>
            "When the time is right," Huey replied in a firm voice. "Now, do you have a wish or not?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所有孩子都非常激动，但却都没想好要许什么样的愿。他们互相看看对方。“我可没时间一天到晚的这样等着，你们也一样。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            “我觉得赛伊应该第一个许愿。”&nbsp;简说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In all their excitement, the children hadn't thought about what to wish for. They looked at each other. "I haven't got all day and neither do you," Huey pointed out. <br>
            "I think Cy should make the first wish," said Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢你，简。”&nbsp;赛伊沾沾自喜地说。<br>
            “为什么是赛伊第一个？”&nbsp;鲍比抱怨说。<br>
            他们三个人争论的时候，潘瑟小声跟自己说：“我希望我们都美丽英俊。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thank you, Jane," said Cy smugly. <br>
            "Why should Cy go first?" complained Bobby. <br>
            While the three of them argued, Panther said softly to herself, "I wish we were beautiful and handsome."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，休伊的鳍发出了粉红和红色的光芒。它们优雅地开合了三次。孩子们停止了争论，全都惊奇地看着休伊。然后他们看到一团白雾。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly Huey's fins glowed pink and red. They opened and closed gracefully three times. The children stopped arguing and looked at Huey in amazement. Then each of them felt a light, soft mist on his or her face.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “发生了什么？”&nbsp;鲍比害怕地问。<br>
            “你的愿望正在实现。”&nbsp;休伊回答。<br>
            “我们的愿望？什么愿望？”&nbsp;赛伊疑惑地问。<br>
            他们感觉那些雾离开了自己的脸。<br>
            “变得美丽英俊的愿望啊。”&nbsp;休伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's happening?" Bobby asked in a scared voice. <br>
            "Your wish is being granted," replied Huey. <br>
            "Our wish? What wish?" Cy asked, puzzled. <br>
            They felt the mist lift from their faces. <br>
            "Your wish to become beautiful and handsome," said Huey.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊、鲍比和简互相看着，又看看潘瑟。他们都在想休伊说的是什么意思，但孩子们在盯着对方的时候互相都不认识了。就像潘瑟许的愿一样，他们每个人都变得像电影明星一样美丽英俊了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy, Bobby, and Jane looked at each other, and at Panther too, wondering what Huey meant. But none of the children recognized the faces staring back. Just as Panther had wished, each of them was as beautiful or handsome as a movie star.

            巴斯家的孩子们都认不出对方了。“赛伊？”&nbsp;潘瑟一边问一边去碰一个小男孩儿。他有着黑色的卷发和清澈的蓝眼睛。<br>
            “潘瑟？”&nbsp;赛伊说。他摸到的是她挽成一个扣的金色长卷发。潘瑟的头发之前通常是棕色直发，发型也非常简单。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Barth children could not recognize each other. "Cy?" Panther asked, reaching out to a young boy with dark, wavy hair and clear blue eyes. <br>
            "Panther?" Cy said. He touched a long wavy lock of her golden hair. Panther's hair was normally straight brown and quite plain.

            “谁有镜子？”&nbsp;简问。“我看上去怎么样？”&nbsp;简也漂亮极了。她的短发是红色的，微微卷着坠在脸旁。她的皮肤像玫瑰一样娇嫩。她还有了一双像绿宝石一样的眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Does anyone have a mirror?" asked Jane. "What do I look like?" Jane was absolutely beautiful. She had short red hair with little curls around her face. Her skin was rosy, and she had bright, shining green eyes.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不知道为什么每个人都想变漂亮。”&nbsp;鲍比抱怨说。“这是你的主意，对不对，潘瑟？”&nbsp;<br>

            孩子们走回了镇上。很多人开始盯着他们看。

            "Good, lovely, and all that," Huey interrupted. "Now, be off with you. Remember that your wish ends at sunset." Huey disappeared back into his shell. Cy carefully lowered him back down into the well. <br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我一定很美，因为每个人都在看我。”&nbsp;潘瑟想。就在那一刻，她认出了玛莎阿姨的邻居。“看！那是贝克尔先生。”&nbsp;她说。贝克尔先生在遛他的狗，西尔弗。“你好，贝克尔先生！你好，西尔弗！”&nbsp;潘瑟开心地叫道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I must be beautiful because everyone is looking at me," thought Panther. Just then, she recognized Aunt Martha's neighbor. "Look! There's Mr. Becker," she said. Mr. Becker was walking his dog, Silver. "Hello, Mr. Becker! Hello, Silver!" Panther called out cheerfully.

    </div>
    <div>

            潘瑟很喜欢小动物。他们来玛莎阿姨家后很快就认识了贝克尔先生。但现在贝克尔先生和西尔弗看上去都不认识她了。“汪！汪！”&nbsp;西尔弗愤怒地叫着。“怎么了，西尔弗？是我啊，潘瑟！”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther, being an animal lover, had gotten to know Silver as soon as they had arrived at Aunt Martha's. Now, however, neither Mr. Becker nor Silver seemed to recognize her. <br>
            "Woof! Woof!" Silver barked angrily. <br>
            "What's the matter, Silver? It's me, Panther!" she said.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther bent down to pet the dog's head. <br>

            Bobby faced his neighbor. "Mr. Becker, it's Bobby Barth!" he said. "We live next door."

            贝克尔先生怀疑地看看每个孩子。“我不知道你们这些孩子是谁。”&nbsp;他坚持说，“但我绝对从来没见过你们。”&nbsp;<br>
            “但是，但是……”&nbsp;潘瑟走上前想要解释。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mr. Becker looked at each child suspiciously. "I don't know who you children are," he said in a stern voice. "But I've never seen you before in my life." <br>
            "But, but . . ." Panther stepped forward, attempting to explain.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，西尔弗冲了过来。潘瑟快步退后，但西尔弗把贝克尔先生手里牵着的皮绳拽掉了。孩子们都被吓了一跳，转身就跑。那条狗兴奋地边追边叫。<br>
            “快跑！”&nbsp;赛伊大叫着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly, Silver lunged. Quickly Panther stepped back, but Silver had pulled the leash from Mr. Becker's hand. Startled, the children all turned and fled. Excitedly, the barking dog gave chase. <br>
            "Run!" yelled Cy.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children ran toward their aunt's house. "I hope Aunt Martha is home!" gasped Panther. Luckily for the children, the front door was open. <br>
            "Hurry!" Cy shouted to his siblings. He slammed the door behind them, just as Silver reached the steps.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children collapsed onto the floor. "That was a close call," Bobby sighed loudly. <br>
            "Why did Silver chase me? He loves me!" wailed Panther, her beautiful eyes filling with tears.

            “因为你看上去不一样了。”&nbsp;赛伊解释说,&nbsp;但这并不能让潘瑟感觉好一点儿。孩子们在整个家里找玛莎阿姨和兰姆。“她不在家。”&nbsp;赛伊说。大家都跟着他进了厨房。“也许她去买东西了？”&nbsp;简说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Because you look different," Cy pointed out, but it didn't help Panther feel much better. <br>

            "Maybe she went shopping?" said Jane.

            "I'm going to get a hundred games so I won't ever be bored," he answered.

            “我要买辆车。”&nbsp;鲍比说。他的眼睛里闪着光。<br>
            “你不会开车啊！”&nbsp;简说。<br>
            鲍比耸耸肩说：“没事儿。我雇个司机给我开就行了。”&nbsp;

            "I'm going to buy a car," Bobby said with a sparkle in his eye. <br>

            赛伊在一家店门前停下了脚步。“我们到了！”&nbsp;他说。他举起他的手指着一块写着“游戏世界”&nbsp;的牌子。<br>
            “我不想去那家店。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “我也不想。”&nbsp;简表示赞同。

            Cy stopped in front of a store. "Here we are," he said. He lifted his hand toward the sign that read "Game World." <br>

            "Me neither," agreed Jane.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm going to Dot's Dress Shop to look at skirts," said Panther. <br>

            其他几个孩子马上同意了。<br>

            “哇！”&nbsp;他屏住了呼吸说。<br>
            “我能帮你什么忙吗？”&nbsp;店员问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The others quickly agreed. <br>
            Cy walked into the game store alone. His eyes fell on the rows and rows of games. "Wow!" he said, sucking in his breath. <br>
            "Can I help you?" asked the store clerk.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;赛伊回答，“店里每种游戏给我来一套。”&nbsp;<br>
            鲍比呢？他去看车了。他用手指触碰着一辆双门银色跑车。<br>
            “你在给爸爸看生日礼物吗？”&nbsp;一个汽车销售员开玩笑说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes," Cy answered. "I want one of every game in the store." <br>
            Meanwhile, Bobby went to look at cars. He fingered a two-door silver sports car. <br>
            "Are you looking for a birthday gift for your dad?" one car salesman teased.

            鲍比高高地昂着头离开了这家店。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Maybe he's saving up to buy it in ten years," laughed another. <br>
            "More like twenty years," roared the other. <br>
            Bobby held his head high and left the store. "They'll see," he thought.

            潘瑟和简去了多特服装店买衣服。女孩们试了很多件裙子，最后找到了一件她们都喜欢的。<br>
            “简，那是我的裙子。”&nbsp;潘瑟指着简手里的裙子说。那和潘瑟穿在身上的裙子一模一样。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther and Jane went to Dot's Dress Shop to buy some clothes. The girls tried on many dresses and both found one that they liked. <br>
            "Jane, that's my dress," said Panther, pointing to the dress Jane was trying on. It was exactly the same one that Panther had on.

            “那你为什么不再找一条？”&nbsp;简用令人讨厌的语气回答说。<br>
            而在游戏商店里，赛伊站在结账柜台前。他正在清点所有的新游戏。这些很快就都是他的了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's my dress. I saw it first," Jane replied hotly. <br>

            "Why don't you?" Jane replied nastily. <br>
            Back at the game store, Cy stood at the checkout. He was counting all the new games that were soon to be his.

            “我可是个非常有钱的人。”&nbsp;赛伊自命不凡地回答说。<br>
            “也许你应该先给我看看你的钱。”&nbsp;店员说。他的眼珠子转来转去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Look, boy," said the clerk, "how are you going to pay for all this?" <br>

            "Maybe you should show me the money first," the clerk said, rolling his eyes.

            赛伊向他的妹妹们解释了刚才发生的情况。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy led the children to a park where they collapsed on some benches. They sat for a while catching their breath. <br>
            "Did you buy your games?" Panther asked, her voice calmer now. <br>
            Cy explained to his sisters what had happened.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比一句话没说。他依然在生赛伊的气。之后潘瑟也告诉了她的兄弟们多特服装店里发生的事情。<br>
            “我们可能变得有钱了，但这些金币对我们来说一点儿好处都没有。”&nbsp;赛伊总结道。每个人都对他的看法表示赞同。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby did not say a word. He was still mad at Cy. Then Panther told her brothers what had happened at Dot's. <br>
            "We might have been rich, but those gold coins did nothing good for us," concluded Cy. Everyone agreed.

            “而且我很过分，简。”&nbsp;潘瑟说，“对不起。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我也很抱歉，潘瑟。”&nbsp;简说。“还有，你穿那条裙子很好看。”&nbsp;简拥抱了她的姐姐。<br>
            “嘿，卖冰淇淋的人来了！”&nbsp;赛伊大叫着跳了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And I acted very badly, Jane," said Panther. "I'm sorry." <br>
            "I'm sorry, too, Panther," said Jane. "By the way, you did look pretty in that dress." Jane hugged her sister. <br>
            "Hey, the ice cream man is here!" Cy called, jumping up.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他跑向了一边播放音乐，一边朝这边开来的一辆冰淇淋车。他的姐妹们和他一起去了，但鲍比跟在后面，拖拖拉拉地走着。“我请客。”&nbsp;赛伊主动说，“你们想吃哪种都可以。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He ran toward an ice cream truck that was playing music as it approached. His sisters went with him, but Bobby followed behind, dragging his feet. "My treat," offered Cy. "So have whatever you want."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟和简都选了草莓口味加巧克力酱，赛伊则选择香草焦糖口味。“嘿，鲍比！”&nbsp;赛伊大声叫着，“你为什么不来个巧克力棉花糖味道的呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther and Jane both chose strawberry with a scoop of chocolate, and Cy got vanilla caramel. "Hey, Bobby," called out Cy. "Why don't you get chocolate marshmallow?"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我什么都不想要。不要再对我指手画脚了！”&nbsp;鲍比嚷了回来。<br>
            其他孩子都你看看我，我看看你。<br>
            “他还在生我的气。”&nbsp;赛伊耸耸肩，“他会很快忘了这件事情的。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't want anything. And stop telling me what to do!" Bobby shouted back. <br>
            The other children looked at each other. <br>
            "He's still mad at me," shrugged Cy. "He'll get over it."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊将他留在口袋里的两枚金币递给了卖冰淇淋的人。那个男人摇摇头说：“这是什么？游戏币？”&nbsp;<br>
            赛伊对着那个人懒懒地笑了一下，拿出了他的钱包。他用自己的钱付了冰淇淋的钱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy handed the ice cream man two gold coins that he had left in his pocket. The man shook his head and said, "What's this? Play money?"  <br>
            Cy gave the man a weary smile and took out his wallet. He paid for the ice cream with his own money.

            第二天一早，鲍比是第一个醒来的。他悄悄地穿好了衣服，并在太阳一升起的时候就溜出了房子。<br>
            今天轮到鲍比许愿了。他很清楚自己想要什么。他穿过森林，找到了那口古井。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, Bobby was the first to wake up. He dressed quietly and snuck out of the house just as the sun began to rise. Today was Bobby's turn to make a wish, and he knew exactly what he wanted. He walked through the forest and found the old well.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “休伊，休伊！”&nbsp;鲍比一边焦急地叫着，一边将木桶从井底拉了上来。<br>
            休伊慢慢从他的壳里探出头来。他满脸睡意地看着鲍比：“你知道现在是什么时间吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我要许愿。”&nbsp;鲍比说。他完全无视了休伊的表情。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Huey, Huey!" Bobby called impatiently as he pulled the bucket up from the well. <br>
            Huey slowly poked his head out of his shell. He looked sleepily at Bobby. "Do you know what time it is?" <br>
            "I want to make a wish," Bobby said, ignoring him.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “其他人在哪里？”&nbsp;休伊四处看了看问。<br>
            “没关系的。今天轮到我许愿了。”&nbsp;鲍比迅速回答。<br>
            休伊饶有兴趣地盯着他。“好，那么，你的愿望是什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            鲍比闭上了眼睛说：“我希望我是家里唯一的孩子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where are the others?" Huey asked, looking around. <br>
            "It doesn't matter. Today it's my turn," Bobby answered hastily. <br>
            Huey glanced at him curiously. "Okay, then. What is your wish?" <br>
            Bobby closed his eyes and said, "I wish I was an only child."

            鲍比睁开眼睛的时候，一切看上去都没有变化。“我的愿望实现了吗？”&nbsp;他问休伊。<br>
            休伊打了个哈欠。“你得回家自己看看。”&nbsp;他回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When Bobby opened his eyes, everything looked the same. "Has my wish been granted?" he asked Huey. <br>
            Huey yawned. "You'll have to go home and find out for yourself," he replied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比转身准备走，正在这时休伊说：“你是不是忘了什么事情？”&nbsp;<br>
            鲍比抓了抓脑袋，四处看了看。<br>
            “我。”&nbsp;休伊说。他指了指那口井。<br>
            鲍比将休伊的壳放回了桶里，把他送回了井底。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby turned to leave, when Huey said, "Aren't you forgetting something?" <br>
            Bobby scratched his head and looked around. <br>
            "Me," Huey said. He pointed to the well. <br>
            Bobby put Huey's shell back into the bucket and lowered him down.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，鲍比就尽他最快的速度跑回了家，连声谢谢或再见都没来得及说。<br>
            “有人吗？赛伊？潘瑟？简？”&nbsp;鲍比一边跑进房子里，一边大声叫着其他兄弟姐妹的名字。没人应声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then without a thank you or good-bye, Bobby ran back home as fast as he could. <br>
            "Hello? Cy? Panther? Jane?" Bobby called out the names of his brother and sisters as he ran into the house. No one answered.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比跑进了他和赛伊的房间。房里只有一张床了。然后，他又跑进了女生的房间里。那个房间里堆满了旧箱子和书。<br>
            “耶！”&nbsp;鲍比兴奋地大叫起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby ran up to the room he shared with Cy. There was only one bed. Then he ran to the girls' room. That room was filled with old boxes and books. <br>
            "Yippie!" Bobby shouted gleefully.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他跳起舞来，为自己终于可以独自一人而感到欢喜。鲍比以前经常想象没有兄弟姐妹会是什么样子。如果没有兄弟姐妹，他就再也不用分享、等待或排队了。“现在没人能对我指手画脚了！”&nbsp;声说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He danced around, rejoicing that he was alone. Bobby had often wondered what it would be like to have no brothers or sisters. Never having to share, wait, or take turns. "Now no one can tell me what to do!" he said aloud.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你到底在干什么？”&nbsp;他身后有人尖声叫道。<br>
            鲍比转身看到了他的阿姨。他跑过去给了她一个拥抱。“玛莎阿姨！我看到你太高兴了！”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “你怎么了？你还好吗？”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨问。她用手摸了摸鲍比的额头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What do you think you're doing?" a voice from behind said sharply. <br>
            Bobby whirled around to face his aunt. He ran and gave her a hug. "Aunt Martha! Am I glad to see you!" he said. <br>
            "What's the matter with you? Are you feeling all right?" asked Aunt Martha. She put her hand on Bobby's forehead.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我特别好。”&nbsp;鲍比大笑道。<br>
            “那就好。”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨回答。<br>
            “因为我们有很多事情要做。”&nbsp;她把真空吸尘器递给了鲍比。“你可以从楼下的卧室开始。不要错过任何一个角落！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm perfectly fine," laughed Bobby. <br>
            "Glad to hear it," replied Aunt Martha, "because we've got a lot to do." She handed Bobby the vacuum cleaner. "You can start by vacuuming the living room downstairs. Don't miss any spots!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好的，玛莎阿姨。”&nbsp;鲍比回答。他没刚才那么开心了。<br>
            鲍比打扫干净卧室后，他突然想起了从前。他和赛伊以前一直假装吸尘器是个怪物。赛伊会一边追着他四处跑一边叫：“他要吃了你！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Okay, Aunt Martha," Bobby answered, a little less happily. <br>
            As Bobby vacuumed the living room, a memory popped into his head. He and Cy used to pretend that the vacuum was a monster. Cy would chase him around shouting, "He's going to suck you up!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比不得不承认，他的哥哥并不总是那么坏的。他们确实曾一起度过很有意思的时光。<br>
            玛莎阿姨走了进来。“你怎么花了这么长时间？”&nbsp;她说着穿上了自己的外套。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby had to admit that his brother wasn't always bad. They did have some fun times together. <br>
            Aunt Martha walked in. "What's taking you so long?" she said, putting on her coat.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，我，嗯......”&nbsp;鲍比支支吾吾地说。<br>
            玛莎阿姨摇摇头。“没事。”&nbsp;她说，“穿上你的夹克，我们去基弗先生店里。”&nbsp;<br>
            基弗先生在城里开了一家小杂货店。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, I, uh . . . ," stuttered Bobby. <br>
            Aunt Martha shook her head. "Never mind," she said. "Get your jacket. We're going to Mr. Keefer's." <br>
            Mr. Keefer owned the little grocery in town.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟和简以前很喜欢去那里，因为基弗先生总是给她们糖果。<br>
            无论女孩子们什么时候到家，简总是会向她的兄弟们展示她得到的糖果。<br>
            “很好吃！我最喜欢的糖果！”&nbsp;她会一边说，一边把一个樱桃味儿的糖扔进嘴里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther and Jane used to love going there because Mr. Keefer always gave them candy. <br>
            Whenever the girls got home, Jane would always show off her candy to her brothers. "Yummy! My favorite!" she would say, popping a cherry candy into her mouth.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但潘瑟总是会把包递给鲍比说：“给你，鲍比，拿点我的糖。”&nbsp;当鲍比和玛莎阿姨朝着杂货店走去的时候，鲍比加快了速度跟上玛莎阿姨的步子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But Panther would hold out the bag to Bobby and say, "Here, Bobby, take some of mine." <br>
            Bobby walked fast to keep up with Aunt Martha as they headed toward the grocery.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要买些蔬菜。”&nbsp;当他们到了基弗先生的店里时，玛莎阿姨说。“这是清单。你去拿其他的东西，然后我们在结账台会合。”&nbsp;<br>
            鲍比无助地看着清单。“但是......”&nbsp;他开口说。<br>
            然而，玛莎阿姨已经消失在了过道里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm going to get the vegetables," Aunt Martha said when they got to Mr. Keefer's. "Here is the list. You get the other things and I'll meet you at the cash register." <br>
            Bobby looked helplessly at the list. "But . . . ," he began. <br>
            But Aunt Martha had already disappeared down an aisle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “无糖玉米罐头。”&nbsp;鲍比念着清单。他开始在过道里上下寻找，但却始终找不到该往哪里走。“要是潘瑟在就好了。”&nbsp;他低声说。“她一定知道这些东西都摆在哪里。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Unsweetened canned corn," read Bobby. He searched up and down the aisle but could not figure out where to go. "If only Panther were here," he said under his breath. "She would know where everything is."

            鲍比只找到了玛莎阿姨购物清单上的一样东西：番茄汤。他拿着它去了结账柜台。基弗先生隔着厚厚的眼镜片儿盯着他。鲍比试着微笑，但他是一个害羞的男孩儿，他觉得很不自在。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby could find only one item on Aunt Martha's list: tomato soup. He took it to the counter. Mr. Keefer peered at him from behind thick glasses. Bobby tried to smile, but being a shy boy, he felt very uncomfortable.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            简是这几个孩子里面最外向的。她总是微笑着和每个人交谈。鲍比注意到了结账柜台上一只泰迪熊身上系着的彩色气球。“一个气球多少钱？”&nbsp;他问。兰姆特别喜欢玩儿气球，所以鲍比想给他买一个。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Jane was the most outgoing of the children. She smiled and talked to everyone. <br>
            Bobby noticed colorful balloons tied to a teddy bear on the counter. "How much for a balloon?" he asked. Lamb loved to play with balloons, so Bobby wanted to get him some.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Aunt Martha gave Bobby a strange look. "Who?" she asked. <br>
            "For the bab . . . ," Bobby began before he realized that there was no Lamb. "Uh, nothing. Maybe I won't take them," he said quickly. For some reason, Bobby suddenly felt like crying.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Since he was alone now, he could have more of everything. Happily, Bobby grabbed a handful of candies. <br>
            Aunt Martha was upset that Bobby had not helped more with the shopping. Still, she made him his favorite sandwich before leaving to meet her friend.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            虽然鲍比很喜欢花生黄油配腌黄瓜三明治，但一个人吃，一点儿意思都没有。<br>
            周围安静的让他感到悲伤，所以他出门了。他捡起一个足球，但没人和他一起玩儿。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Even though Bobby loved peanut butter and pickle sandwiches, it was no fun to eat this snack alone. <br>
            The silence around him was making him sad, so he went outside. He picked up a soccer ball, but there was nobody to play with.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他骑上自行车，但一个人骑车也没意思。他抬头看看阳光灿烂的天空。“还有多久太阳才会落山啊？”&nbsp;他想。这一天似乎比以往任何时候都要长。<br>
            鲍比努力地去想他的兄弟姐妹们曾对他做过的一切坏事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He got on his bike, but it was no fun riding by himself. He looked up at the bright sunny sky. "How long before the sun sets?" he wondered. The day seemed to be unusually long. <br>
            Bobby thought very hard of all the bad things his brother and sisters did to him.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他努力装作一点儿也不思念他的兄弟姐妹的样子。“赛伊总是戏弄我。”&nbsp;他大声说。“简总是尖叫。潘瑟一直都喜欢发号施令。兰姆一天到晚地哭。”&nbsp;但事实上，他非常想念他们。<br>
            突然，一个可怕的想法闯进了他的脑袋。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He tried to act as if he didn't miss his siblings. "Cy always teases me," he said aloud. "Jane always screams. Panther acts like she's the boss. Lamb cries all the time." But the truth was, he missed them terribly. <br>
            Then a horrible thought entered his head.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            要是他再也见不到赛伊、潘瑟、简和兰姆了怎么办？鲍比的心开始砰砰跳。“如果休伊走了，我的愿望永远不会消失了怎么办？”&nbsp;他说。他怕极了，怕得说不出话来。鲍比用最快的速度穿过了森林。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            What if he never saw Cy or Panther or Jane or Lamb again? Bobby's heart began to thump loudly. "What if Huey is gone and my wish will never be undone?" he said. Too scared to say anything more, Bobby ran as fast as he could through the woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他跑到了休伊的井边，然后试着将那个木桶从井底拉上来。<br>
            “休伊！休伊！我改变主意了！”&nbsp;鲍比大叫着用尽全力去拉那个木桶。不知为什么，那个木桶在井底一动不动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He reached Huey's well and tried to pull the bucket up. <br>
            "Huey! Huey! I've changed my mind!" Bobby cried, pulling with all his might. For some reason, the bucket would not move.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不！不！”&nbsp;鲍比大叫着，但绳子依然纹丝不动，木桶静静地停留在井底。鲍比跌坐在地上大哭。他怕得要死，又觉得非常孤单。最后，他精疲力尽地闭上了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No! No!" screamed Bobby, but the rope remained taut, and the bucket stuck firmly to the bottom of the well. Bobby fell to the ground, crying, afraid, and very much alone. Exhausted and tired, he closed his eyes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比再次睁开眼睛的时候，他过了好一会儿才想起自己在哪里。他一定是在休伊的井边睡着了。<br>
            “鲍比？”&nbsp;远处传来了一个熟悉的声音。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When Bobby opened his eyes again, it took a moment for him to remember where he was. He must have fallen asleep next to Huey's well. <br>
            "Bobby?" a familiar voice called from the distance.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比的心怦怦直跳。他知道那个声音。赛伊、潘瑟和简从树后面向他跑来。鲍比忍不住哭了。“我真的非常非常抱歉。”&nbsp;他大哭着去拥抱他的兄弟姐妹。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobby's heart skipped a beat. He knew that voice. From the trees, Cy, Panther, and Jane came running toward him. Bobby could not hold back his tears. "I'm so sorry," he cried as he hugged his brother and sisters.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们奇怪地看着他，但却一句话都没说。<br>
            太阳落山了。鲍比再次见到家人后，实在是太开心了，几乎压抑不住自己的快乐。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They looked at him strangely, but did not say anything. <br>
            As the sun disappeared behind the hill, Bobby was so glad to see his family again that he could have burst with happiness.

            晚餐的时候，孩子们围坐在餐桌边吃饭。鲍比因为和自己的兄弟姐妹再一次在一起吃饭而感到非常开心。“你们怎么知道我在井边的？”&nbsp;他问他们。<br>
            “玛莎阿姨担心了。”&nbsp;潘瑟回答，“我们一整天都没看到你。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At dinnertime, the children sat around the table to eat. Bobby felt happy to be eating a meal again with his siblings. "How did you know I was at the well?" he asked them. <br>
            "Aunt Martha was getting worried," Panther answered. "We hadn't seen you all day."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “所以我们找不到你的时候，我们就决定去森林里看看。”&nbsp;赛伊最后说。<br>
            “够了，简。”&nbsp;潘瑟批评道。简拿了很多炸鸡，她根本吃不了那么多。“把这些留给鲍比。”&nbsp;潘瑟从简那里把盘子端走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So when we couldn't find you, we decided to look in the woods," finished Cy. <br>
            "That's enough, Jane," scolded Panther. Jane was taking more fried chicken than she could eat. "Leave those for Bobby." Panther took the plate away from her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “没关系的。简能吃完的。”&nbsp;鲍比微笑着说。<br>
            大家吃惊地地盯着他。<br>
            “你今天实在太奇怪了。你还好吗？”&nbsp;赛伊用关心的语气问。<br>
            鲍比点点头，认真地问：“你们今天都做了什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's okay. Jane can have them all," smiled Bobby. <br>
            The others stared at him in shock. <br>
            "You've been acting strange. Are you okay?" Cy asked in a concerned voice. <br>
            Bobby nodded and carefully asked, "What did you do today?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊打了个哈欠回答说：“今天真的很奇怪。我感觉自己一整天都在睡觉。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我也是。”&nbsp;潘瑟说，“我都不记得自己做了什么。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我什么梦都没做。”&nbsp;简说。她塞了一嘴的炸鸡。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy yawned and replied, "It was really weird. I feel like I've been sleeping all day." <br>
            "Me, too," said Panther. "And I don't remember doing anything." <br>
            "I didn't have any dreams," Jane said, her mouth full of chicken.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “玛莎阿姨说她以为我们去基弗先生店里了，但她不确定。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            “等一下。”&nbsp;赛伊怀疑地看着鲍比，“你见过休伊了吗？你许了什么愿望？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Aunt Martha says she thinks we went to Mr. Keefer's, but she's not sure," said Panther. <br>
            "Wait a minute." Cy looked at Bobby suspiciously. "Did you see Huey? What did you wish for?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是鲍比把一切都告诉了他们，每个人听了之后都一言不发。<br>
            鲍比说完后羞愧地低下了头。<br>
            “我一直在想，如果我是家里唯一的孩子会是什么样子。”&nbsp;过了一会潘瑟说。“我告诉你，那一点儿意思都没有。”&nbsp;鲍比深有感触地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So Bobby told them everything, and everyone listened and didn't say a word. After Bobby finished, he hung his head in shame. <br>
            "I've always wondered what it would be like to be an only child," Panther said after a while. <br>
            "It's no fun, I tell you!" Bobby said emphatically.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望你现在珍惜像我这么好的哥哥。”&nbsp;赛伊很夸张地张开了他的双臂。可是他不小心打翻了牛奶。牛奶全部洒在了简的身上，简大声尖叫起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I hope you appreciate what a great brother I am now," said Cy, spreading his arms dramatically. As he did this, he accidentally knocked over the milk. It splashed all over Jane, and she screamed loudly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “赛伊！”&nbsp;潘瑟用妈妈般的口气说。<br>
            鲍比笑了，一切都恢复了平常的样子。<br>
            第二天一早，简非常激动。她催着每个人赶快吃完早饭。今天轮到她许愿了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, Cy," Panther said in a motherly voice. <br>
            Bobby grinned. Everything was back to normal again. <br>
            The next morning, Jane was very excited. She hurried everyone through breakfast. It was her turn to make a wish.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你仔细思考过你的愿望了吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟担心地问。<br>
            “当然啦！”&nbsp;简不耐烦地说。<br>
            “也许你应该先告诉我们你要许什么样的愿望。”&nbsp;赛伊建议说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Have you thought carefully about your wish?" Panther asked in a worried voice. <br>
            "Of course," Jane said impatiently. <br>
            "Maybe you should tell us what your wish is first," suggested Cy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不！”&nbsp;简说着摇摇头，“给你们一个惊喜。”&nbsp;<br>
            其他的孩子看了看彼此。在经历了过去几天的事情之后，他们并没有像一开始那么积极去许愿了。<br>
            “来吧！”&nbsp;简说着朝大门走去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No," Jane said, shaking her head. "It's a surprise." <br>
            The other children looked at each other. After their past experiences, they weren't as eager to make wishes as they had been before. <br>
            "Come on," Jane said and headed toward the door.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们到井边的时候，鲍比屏住了呼吸。他记得昨天木桶动都不动。但是，赛伊很轻松地就用绳子顺利地把木桶拉了上来，休伊的壳就在桶里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When they got to the well, Bobby held his breath. He remembered that the bucket would not move the day before. But Cy had no trouble as the rope smoothly pulled up the bucket, with Huey's shell inside.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们呼唤着休伊。过了几分钟，休伊终于把他的脑袋探了出来。<br>
            “在你们开口之前，”&nbsp;他开始说话了，“我要再一次提醒你们。”&nbsp;他伸出了两根手指：“第一，你们许的任何愿望都会在日落时失效。第二，你们许完愿后就不可以再来打扰我了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children called for Huey for a few minutes before he finally stuck his head out. "Before you say anything," he started, "let me remind you once again." He lifted two fingers. "One, whatever you wish for ends at sunset. Two, after you make a wish you must not bother me."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他盯了鲍比好一会儿。鲍比低头看着自己的脚。“我不会让愿望失效，”&nbsp;休伊继续说道，“所以你们在许愿之前必须考虑好。”&nbsp;<br>
            除了简以外的每个人看上去都忧心忡忡的样子。<br>
            潘瑟和其他人希望简在许愿之前再想一想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He stared at Bobby for a long time. Bobby looked down at his feet. "I cannot undo your wish," continued Huey, "so you have to think before you wish it." <br>
            Everyone except Jane looked worried. Panther and the others wanted Jane to think before making a wish.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但这是我的愿望。”&nbsp;简自己微笑着说。“我现在可以许愿了吗？休伊？”&nbsp;她激动地小声说。<br>
            只有她按自己想的许愿才公平。<br>
            简双手合十，闭上了眼睛。她说：“我希望我们拥有翅膀。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But it's my wish," Jane said, smiling to herself. "Can I make my wish now, Huey?" she whispered excitedly. <br>
            And it was only fair that she wish for whatever she wanted. <br>
            Jane clasped her hands together and, closing her eyes, she said, "I wish we had wings."

            Cy, Panther, and Bobby stared at Jane. <br>

            Jane's eyes welled up with tears as she nodded. "I've always wanted to fly." <br>
            Suddenly everyone started talking at once.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ahem." Huey cleared his throat. <br>
            When nobody paid attention to him, Huey clapped his hands loudly. <br>
            "If I may interrupt," he said, "it is Jane's wish to fly. And it is too late to undo her wish!" Huey crossed his arms and leaned against his shell.

            她摆动着背上白色的翅膀。羽毛飞得到处都是。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Two white bumps appeared. Then they started to grow and grow and grow. Soon the children looked as if they had a huge white bag on each shoulder. <br>

            She wiggled the white humps on her back. Feathers flew everywhere.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Jane closed her eyes and calmly let out a long breath. Then, like umbrellas unfolding, the two humps on her back opened up. They turned into beautiful angel wings. The wings were about three meters across.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哇哦！”&nbsp;其他的孩子们惊奇地大叫着。<br>
            简昂起头，弯曲了膝盖。然后，她用双脚轻轻蹬了一下地面。当简跳起来的时候，她的翅膀就开始拍打起来。<br>
            “我要飞了！我要飞了！”&nbsp;简激动地叫着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wow!" the others shouted in amazement. <br>
            Jane lifted her head and bent her knees. Then she pushed off with her feet. As she got higher, Jane's wings began to flap. <br>
            "I'm flying! I'm flying!" she screamed excitedly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她的兄弟姐妹们也跟着她做。他们的翅膀一个接一个地打开了。不一会儿，他们就在天空中与简会合了。“简！”&nbsp;潘瑟大叫，“这是我们到今天为止许过的最好的愿望！”&nbsp;<br>
            简对着自己的姐姐微笑了一下，然后开始朝着太阳飞得更高了一些。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Her brothers and sister did exactly as Jane had done. One by one, their wings opened up and soon they joined their sister in the sky. <br>
            "Jane!" shouted Panther. "This is the best wish we've made so far." <br>
            Jane beamed at her sister as she flew up higher toward the sun.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嘿，看！”&nbsp;鲍比向下指着地面说。<br>
            在他们的下方是他们住的那个村子。孩子们可以看到人们在街道上走来走去。<br>
            “他们看上去和虫子一样小。”&nbsp;赛伊笑了。<br>
            “那是玛莎阿姨的房子！”&nbsp;潘瑟指着前方说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hey, look!" Bobby pointed down at the ground. <br>
            Beneath them was their village. The children could see people walking up and down the streets. <br>
            "They look like bugs," laughed Cy. <br>
            "There's Aunt Martha's house!" Panther pointed ahead.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们像一群鸟一样慢慢地朝着那个方向飞过去。<br>
            “玛莎阿姨在那儿呢。”&nbsp;赛伊用一只手挡在眼睛上方向下看去。<br>
            “她在种花。”&nbsp;潘瑟补充说。<br>
            “哦，那是我们的小宝宝，兰姆！”&nbsp;简大叫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Like a flock of birds, the children flew smoothly in that direction. <br>
            "There's Aunt Martha." Cy held one hand over his eyes as he peered down. <br>
            "She's planting some flowers," Panther added. <br>
            "Oh, and there's our baby Lamb!" shouted Jane.

            他们清楚地看到兰姆坐在毯子上玩儿着他的玩具。<br>

            “鲍比！不要！”&nbsp;赛伊抓住了鲍比的手臂。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Sure enough, Lamb was sitting on a blanket playing with his toys. <br>
            "Aunt Martha! Lamb!" Bobby suddenly began to shout and wave his arms. <br>
            "Bobby, stop it!" Cy grabbed Bobby's hand.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            因为男孩子们在相互争论，他们忘记了继续拍打他们的翅膀。<br>
            “哇！”&nbsp;赛伊和鲍比开始往下掉。<br>
            兰姆听见了熟悉的声音。“鲍比！赛伊！”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “你刚刚是叫了你的哥哥们的名字吗？”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨自豪地问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Because the boys were arguing, they forgot to keep flapping their wings. <br>
            "Whoa!" Cy and Bobby began falling. <br>
            Lamb heard familiar voices. "Bobba! Cy!" he said. <br>
            "Did you say your brothers' names?" Aunt Martha asked proudly.

            “继续挥动你们的翅膀啊！”&nbsp;<br>

            "Cy. Bobba." Lamb reached out his chubby arms to the sky. <br>

            But the boys kept falling and falling.

            赛伊和鲍比向地面坠落的速度更快了。他们抓住了彼此。<br>
            “鲍比！”&nbsp;赛伊大叫着，“拍打你的翅膀。一直拍打它们不要停！”&nbsp;<br>
            这对兄弟很快重新掌握了飞翔的技巧。他们向上朝着姐妹们飞去。<br>
            “刚刚实在太惊险了。”&nbsp;赛伊颤抖着声音说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy and Bobby held on to each other as they fell faster to the ground. <br>

            Soon the brothers regained control. They flew over to their sisters. <br>
            "That was a close call," Cy said in a trembling voice.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟朝周围看了一圈儿。她发现了一根粗壮的树枝。“我们去那里休息一会吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们朝着那棵树飞去。简突然问道：“我们要怎么降落？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们必须像收伞那样把翅膀收起来。”&nbsp;过了一会儿潘瑟回答说，“我来试试看。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther looked around. She spotted a large tree branch. "Let's rest over there." <br>
            As the children flew toward the tree, Jane suddenly asked: "How do we land?" <br>
            "The wings have to fold back like an umbrella," Panther said after a while. "Let me try."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟朝着那棵树飞去。她的一只翅膀收了起来，但另一只却挂在了树叶上。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;她大叫。<br>
            其他的孩子就跟在她后面。赛伊平稳地落在了树上。鲍比也没有什么问题。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther flew to the tree. One of her wings folded. The other, however, got caught in the leaves. <br>
            "Ouch!" she cried. <br>
            The other children followed after her. Cy landed gracefully, and so did Bobby.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们做到了！”&nbsp;男孩子们喊道。他们咧开嘴笑了。<br>
            但简却并不想休息。<br>
            “我们没有很多时间了。”&nbsp;她说，“我想尽可能地多飞一会儿。”&nbsp;她昂起头，飞得更高了。<br>
            “我们最好待在一起。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We made it!" the brothers exclaimed, grinning. <br>
            Jane, however, did not want to rest. <br>
            "We don't have much time," she said. "I want to fly as much as I can." She lifted her head and flew higher. <br>
            "We'd better stay together," said Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所以其他人也跟着简飞了起来。<br>
            孩子们飞过了湖泊和高山。孩子们飞过去的时候，鸟儿大声地发出了抗议。<br>
            过了好一会，鲍比说：“我饿了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “但我们能去哪里弄点吃的呢？”&nbsp;潘瑟大声地问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So the others flew after Jane. <br>
            The children flew over lakes and mountains. Birds squawked loudly as the children flew by. <br>
            After a while, Bobby said, "I'm hungry." <br>
            "But where can we get food?" Panther wondered aloud.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们不能带着这些东西到处走啊。”&nbsp;赛伊指着自己的翅膀说。<br>
            要把他们的翅膀藏起来是不可能做到的事情。<br>
            孩子们高高低低地飞着去寻找食物，但他们什么都没找到。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We can't walk around with these things," said Cy. He pointed to his wings. <br>
            It would be impossible to hide their wings. <br>
            The children searched high and low for food. But they could not find anything.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道我们去哪里可以找到吃的。”&nbsp;赛伊说，“农夫詹金斯自己做果酱。”&nbsp;农夫詹金斯是玛莎阿姨的邻居。<br>
            有时候他会给玛莎阿姨送自己家做的面包和果酱。<br>
            “你是说从他那里偷吃的？”&nbsp;潘瑟大叫道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I know where we might find food," said Cy. "Farmer Jenkins makes his own jam." Farmer Jenkins was Aunt Martha's neighbor. Sometimes he gave Aunt Martha homemade bread and jam. <br>
            "You mean steal his food?" shouted Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊脸红了。“不是偷。我们只是借。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这个主意太糟糕了。”&nbsp;潘瑟指责说。<br>
            “你有更好的主意吗？”&nbsp;赛伊反击说。<br>
            潘瑟当然什么主意都没想出来。<br>
            “好吧，如果你保证，我们会把拿的东西再还回去的话。”&nbsp;她最终同意了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy's face turned red. "Not steal it. Just borrow it." <br>
            "That's a terrible idea," scolded Panther. <br>
            "Do you have any better ones?" Cy shot back. <br>
            Of course Panther did not have any ideas at all. <br>
            "Well, if you promise to return what we take," she finally agreed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好，那就跟我来吧。”&nbsp;赛伊转身飞走了。<br>
            他们飞到农场的时候，已经接近傍晚了。<br>
            “他可能将食物放在谷仓里了。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            谷仓有两层。幸运的是，第二层有扇很大的窗户是开着的。孩子们从那扇窗飞了进去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Okay, just follow me." Cy turned around and flew off. <br>
            By the time they reached the farm, it was late afternoon. <br>
            "He probably keeps his food in the barn," said Cy. <br>
            The barn had two floors. Luckily, a large window on the second level was open. The children flew in through that window.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊发现了几个木箱。它们装满了果酱。孩子们一句话都没说就开始吃果酱了。<br>
            “这真好吃。”&nbsp;鲍比舔着嘴唇说。<br>
            “我们必须记清楚我们吃了多少。”&nbsp;潘瑟边说边数空果酱罐。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy found several wooden boxes. They were filled with jam. Without a word, the children ate the jam. <br>
            "That was delicious," Bobby said, licking his lips. <br>
            "We must remember how much we ate," said Panther as she counted the empty jars.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “看！太阳开始落山了！”&nbsp;简指着闪耀着红色光芒的天空说。<br>
            孩子们突然感觉自己变轻了，就好像他们的肩膀上少了些重量似的。<br>
            “翅膀不见了。”&nbsp;简轻声说。她在自己平滑的后背上四处摸着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Look! The sun is setting!" Jane pointed to the glowing red sky. <br>
            Suddenly the children felt lighter, as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. <br>
            "They're gone," whispered Jane, reaching around to touch her flat back.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好吧，我们现在必须从这里出去了。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            但没有翅膀，孩子们就不能再飞出去了。大门在一楼。那里都是动物。<br>
            “我们可以从这个梯子上爬下去。”&nbsp;赛伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, we have to get out of here now," Cy said. <br>
            Without wings, the children could not fly out. The main door was on the ground floor. The animals were kept down there. <br>
            "We can climb down this ladder," said Cy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这一层的中间，有一个大大的正方形开口。开口里放着一架梯子。赛伊爬到了梯子上。<br>
            “来吧！”&nbsp;赛伊边说边往下爬。<br>
            每个孩子都到了一楼后，动物们开始变得吵嚷起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the middle of the floor was a large square opening. There was a ladder inside the opening. Cy got on the ladder. <br>
            "Come on," Cy said as he climbed down. <br>
            As each child climbed down, the animals grew noisier.
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嘘！”&nbsp;潘瑟对着一头叫得特别欢的马小声说。<br>
            赛伊朝着谷仓大门走去。他拉了拉门。门一点儿都没开。他又试了一次。然后，赛伊睁大了双眼看着他的兄弟姐妹们。<br>
            “门锁上了。”&nbsp;
        </div>

            "Hush," Panther whispered to a particularly loud horse. <br>

            The others wondered what she was up to. <br>

            “我要是掉下去怎么办？”&nbsp;她用力吸了口气。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I get it now," smiled Cy. <br>
            The older children lowered the ladder out from the window. Then they leaned it against the barn. <br>
            "Come on, Jane!" Cy shouted. "Climb down the ladder." <br>
            "What if I fall?" She sniffed.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你不会掉下去的，我会拉着你。”&nbsp;他向她保证说。<br>
            简爬了出去，顺着梯子下去了。然后，潘瑟跟着她下去了。<br>
            一楼，农夫詹金斯和他儿子正在开最后一把锁。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You won't. I've got you," he assured her. <br>
            Jane climbed out and down the ladder. Then Panther followed her. <br>
            Downstairs, Farmer Jenkins and his son were just unlocking the last lock.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不管谁在里面，我都听到你的声音了！”&nbsp;农夫詹金斯大叫，“你逃不了了！”&nbsp;<br>
            轮到鲍比了。他迅速跟上了她的姐妹们。突然，谷仓大门朝两侧飞快地打开了。大门发出了一声巨响。赛伊可以听到农夫詹金斯和他儿子在楼下的声音。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Whoever is in there, I can hear you!" Farmer Jenkins shouted. "You can't escape!" <br>
            It was Bobby's turn. He quickly joined his sisters. Suddenly the barn door flew open. It made a thundering sound. Cy could hear Farmer Jenkins and his son down below.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道你在这儿。”&nbsp;农夫詹金斯用生气的声音说。<br>

            赛伊做了一个深呼吸，然后爬了下去。孩子们头都没回地以最快速度跑走了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I know you're in here," Farmer Jenkins shouted in an angry voice. <br>

            回家后，玛莎阿姨生气了。“看看现在外面天黑成什么样了。”&nbsp;她斥责道。<br>
            “我们很抱歉。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            “我太生气了。上楼回房间去！”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨抱起了兰姆。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Back home, Aunt Martha was not happy with the children. "Look how dark it is outside," she scolded. <br>
            "We're sorry," apologized Panther. <br>
            "I'm very upset with you. Go upstairs to your rooms!" Aunt Martha picked up Lamb.

            孩子们看看彼此笑了。<br>
            “最后我们还是没有挨饿啊。”&nbsp;赛伊拍了拍自己的肚子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bobba? Cy? Whee! Whee!" Lamb cried happily. He opened his arms as if they were wings and pretended to fly. <br>
            "Maybe Lamb did see us," Bobby whispered. <br>
            The children looked at each other and smiled. <br>
            "At least we're not hungry." Cy patted his stomach.

            互相说了晚安后，孩子们回到了自己的房间。<br>
            第二天一早，玛莎阿姨给孩子们做了烤薄饼。“今天我要去见朋友。”&nbsp;她说，“你们必须照顾小宝宝。”&nbsp;她把兰姆抱给了潘瑟。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After saying good night, the children went to their rooms. <br>
            The next morning, Aunt Martha made pancakes for the children. "Today I'm meeting my friend," she said. "You'll need to look after the baby." She handed Lamb to Panther.

            "I'll be back at dinner time," Aunt Martha said. <br>

            "What an adorable little human!" he gushed. <br>
            Lamb pointed and said: "Pig."

            但他的妹妹摇摇头说：“我不想许愿。”&nbsp;<br>

            But his sister shook her head. "I don't want to." <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone except Cy was stunned. Even Lamb grew quiet. <br>
            "Did you say dinosaurs?" repeated Bobby. <br>
            "I've always wanted to see a real one," Cy explained. <br>
            Huey cleared his throat and pointed to the well.

            孩子们承认说实际上每个愿望都实现了。<br>
            “那这个愿望也会的。”&nbsp;休伊消失在了他的壳里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But my wish hasn't come true yet," argued Cy. <br>
            Crossing his arms, Huey asked, "Has any wish not come true so far?" <br>
            The children admitted that every wish had indeed come true. <br>
            "This one will too." Huey disappeared into his shell.

            “我们回家吧。”&nbsp;赛伊用失望的声音说。<br>
            孩子们开始往家走，但情况有点儿不一样了。<br>
            “我以前从没有看到过这棵树。”&nbsp;简指着一棵高高的长满了叶子的树。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy lowered him down, mumbling, "I don't see any dinosaurs." <br>
            "Patience!" Huey yelled from his shell. <br>
            "Let's go home," Cy said in a disappointed voice. <br>
            The children started to walk back home. But something was different. <br>
            "I've never seen this tree before." Jane pointed to a tall leafy tree.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这条路看上去很陌生。”&nbsp;潘瑟大声说着搂紧了兰姆。<br>
            “那棵树为什么在动？”&nbsp;鲍比跟在他哥哥身后走了几步。<br>
            一棵树上的叶子摆动个不停。然后，孩子们感觉到地面在颤动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This road looks unfamiliar," Panther remarked, holding Lamb close to her. <br>
            "Why is that tree moving?" Bobby took steps behind his brother. <br>
            The leaves on one tree swayed side to side. Then the children felt the ground tremble.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “有东西朝着这边过来了！”&nbsp;赛伊激动地压低了声音说。<br>
            “那是什么？”&nbsp;简问。她都快哭出来了。<br>
            突然，一只长着很多角的巨大恐龙出现在了树林里。<br>
            “那是犀牛。”&nbsp;鲍比害怕地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Something's coming this way," whispered Cy excitedly. <br>
            "What is it?" Jane asked, close to tears. <br>
            Suddenly a huge dinosaur with many horns appeared among the trees. <br>
            "It's a rhino," Bobby said in awe.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那只巨大的恐龙跟犀牛很像，但它比犀牛大的多，也可怕的多。<br>
            “不，那不是犀牛。”&nbsp;赛伊纠正说。<br>
            “那是尖角龙。”&nbsp;<br>
            那只尖角龙并不知道孩子们在看着它。它继续吃着树上的叶子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The huge dinosaur did resemble a rhinoceros in many ways. But it was much bigger and scarier. <br>
            "No, that's not a rhino," Cy corrected. "That's a Centrosaurus." <br>
            The Centrosaurus did not know the children were watching him. He continued to eat the leaves off the trees and plants.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它危险吗？”&nbsp;简小声说。<br>
            赛伊点点头。“但如果我们不打扰它，我们就是安全的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “所以休伊实现了你的愿望。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            就在那个时候，尖角龙抬起了头，在空气中嗅了嗅。它响亮地哼了一声，在地面上抓了一下。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Is he dangerous?" Jane said in a tiny voice. <br>
            Cy nodded. "But if we don't bother him, we will be safe."<br>
            "So Huey gave you your wish," said Panther. <br>
            At that moment, the Centrosaurus lifted his head and sniffed the air. He grunted loudly and pawed the ground.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦！哦！”&nbsp;赛伊说，“我觉得他闻到我们了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们要怎么做？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>
            “每个人都慢慢往后退。”&nbsp;赛伊平静地说。<br>
            孩子们向后退到了森林深处。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Uh-oh," said Cy, "I think he can smell us." <br>
            "What do we do?" asked Bobby. <br>
            "Everybody move back slowly. Slowly now," Cy said in a calm voice. <br>
            The children stepped back deeper into the woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            安全地远离了恐龙后，赛伊激动地跳了起来。<br>
            “那一定是白垩纪。”&nbsp;他说，“这些恐龙是活在&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;亿年前的。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们饶有兴趣地睁大了眼睛，兰姆除外。他的眼皮快要合上了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Safely away from the dinosaur, Cy jumped up in excitement. <br>
            "This must be the Cretaceous period," he said. "These dinosaurs lived over 130 million years ago." <br>
            The children's eyes grew wide with interest─except for Lamb's. His eyes were getting heavy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “到他午睡时间了。”&nbsp;<br>
            潘瑟低声说。兰姆很快就在怀里睡着了。赛伊在一棵树下发现了一个安全干燥的地方。潘瑟轻轻地把兰姆放在了那里。<br>
            “我们去看更多的恐龙吧。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            “我们不能离开他。”&nbsp;潘瑟态度坚决地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's his nap time," Panther whispered. Lamb was soon fast asleep in her arms. Cy found a safe, dry spot under a tree. Panther gently placed Lamb there. <br>
            "Let's go see more dinosaurs," Cy said. <br>
            "We can't leave him," argued Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们不会走远的。”&nbsp;赛伊说，“就在那棵树周围。”&nbsp;<br>
            潘瑟承认看见恐龙这样巨大的生物是非常惊奇的。她看着兰姆，但却跟在了赛伊后面。<br>
            “那是禽龙。”&nbsp;赛伊指着一只有着长长的僵硬的尾巴的动物说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We won't go far," said Cy. "Just around that tree." <br>
            Panther admitted that seeing the giant creatures was very fascinating. She kept a close eye on Lamb but followed Cy. <br>
            "That one is an Iguanodon," Cy said, pointing to a creature with a long, stiff tail.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那个长了鸭嘴。”&nbsp;简咯咯笑道。她指着一只手臂很短的高大恐龙。<br>
            “那是冠龙。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            “他看上去像是戴了顶头盔。”&nbsp;鲍比大笑着。他指着那只恐龙头上的冠。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That one has a duck's bill," giggled Jane. She stared at a tall dinosaur with short arms. <br>
            "That's a Corythosaurus," Cy said. <br>
            "It looks like he's wearing a helmet." Bobby laughed aloud. He was referring to the crest on its head.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们本来还可以再多看一会恐龙的，但可怕的事情发生了。<br>
            “赛伊，兰姆在哪里？”&nbsp;潘瑟大叫。<br>
            他们回头去看兰姆睡觉的地方，但他不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children would have watched the dinosaurs longer, but something terrible had happened. <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther would not stop crying. "It's all my fault," she kept repeating. <br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            赛伊仔细地研究了那些脚印。然后他说：“这个生物可以用两只脚或者四只脚行走。”&nbsp;“是恐龙带走了兰姆？它如果把兰姆吃了怎么办？”&nbsp;简担心地问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Cy studied the prints carefully. Then he said, "This creature can walk on two or four legs." <br>
            "A dinosaur took Lamb? What if he eats him?" asked Jane, worried.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们不能再浪费时间了。”&nbsp;赛伊跟着那些脚印走。这脚印把他们带到了丛林深处。<br>

            "We can't waste anymore time." Cy followed the footprints. They led them deeper into the forest. <br>

            "What are we going to do now?" sniffed Panther. <br>

            "Something really big is coming," said Bobby.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，他们听到了全世界最恐怖的吼声。他们觉得毛骨悚然。<br>
            “哦！哦！”&nbsp;赛伊喃喃自语道。<br>
            “那是什么？”&nbsp;简低声问。<br>
            地面的颤动变得越来越剧烈。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then they heard the most frightful scream. The hairs on their necks stood up. <br>
            "Uh-oh," muttered Cy. <br>
            "What is it?" whispered Jane. <br>
            The trembling became more intense.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “快跑！”&nbsp;赛伊大叫。<br>
            孩子们朝着传来声音的反方向跑去。<br>
            “不要往回看。”&nbsp;赛伊用他最大的声音叫道。<br>
            但已经太迟了。鲍比回过头去看到底是什么在追他。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Run!" shouted Cy. <br>
            The children took off in the opposite direction of the noise. <br>
            "Don't look back," Cy yelled at the top of his voice. <br>
            But it was too late. Bobby turned around to see what was chasing them.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那是只暴龙！”&nbsp;他尖叫道。然后，他就被绊倒了。<br>
            暴龙是牙齿锋利的大恐龙。它看上去非常生气，也非常凶残。它离鲍比越来越近了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's a T. rex!" he screamed. Then he tripped and fell hard to the ground. <br>
            The Tyrannosaurus rex was a gigantic creature with extremely sharp teeth. It looked very angry and mean. And it was getting closer to where Bobby lay.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “鲍比！快起来！”&nbsp;潘瑟尖叫道。<br>
            但鲍比动不了了。<br>
            就在那个时候，暴龙停了下来。它看着孩子们身后，然后又发出了一声巨大的吼声。孩子们害怕得捂住了耳朵。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bobby! Get up!" screamed Panther. <br>
            But Bobby could not move. <br>
            Just then the T. rex stopped. It looked behind the children. Then it let out another fierce, threatening cry. The children covered their ears to block out the terrifying noises.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            勇敢的赛伊没有捂住耳朵。他想知道是什么让这只恐龙之王停下了脚步。就在他们身后，出现了一只巨大的三角龙。这只长着三个角的怪物低下了脑袋。它已经做好了攻击的准备。<br>
            “暴龙和三角龙要打架了！快走！快走！”&nbsp;赛伊向他的兄弟姐妹大叫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Brave Cy kept his eyes open to see what made the king of dinosaurs stop. Right behind them a massive Triceratops had appeared. The three-horned monster was lowering its head. It was getting ready to attack. <br>
            "The T. rex and Triceratops are going to fight! Get out! Get out!" Cy screamed to his siblings.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们总算安全了。<br>
            “它们会杀掉彼此吗？”&nbsp;简哭了。<br>
            “那是恐龙生存的方式，简。”&nbsp;赛伊试图安慰他的妹妹。“现在我们必须想想兰姆了。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们继续奔跑着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Somehow the children made it to safety. <br>
            "Are they going to kill each other?" cried Jane. <br>
            "That's how dinosaurs survive, Jane." Cy tried to comfort his sister. "Right now we have to think about Lamb."<br>
            The children kept running.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊！”&nbsp;鲍比突然大叫道。<br>
            “啊！小心！”&nbsp;潘瑟随后也叫了出来。赛伊和简应该听到潘瑟的话了，但他们继续跑着。很快他们就跌进了地面上的一个大洞里。这个洞差不多有两米深。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ahhh!" Bobby suddenly yelled. <br>
            "Ahhh! Be careful!" Panther's cries followed. <br>
            Cy and Jane should have listened to their sister. But they kept running. Soon they fell into a large hole in the ground, just as Bobby and Panther had done. It was about two meters deep.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这看上去像个窝。”&nbsp;潘瑟观察着。<br>
            她拣起了一个光滑的椭圆形的蛋。它有一个大柚子那么大。洞里至少有二十个这样的蛋。<br>
            “你是说，”&nbsp;简倒吸了一口冷气，“我们是在恐龙窝里？”&nbsp;<br>
            “看上去是这样的。”&nbsp;赛伊回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It looks like some kind of nest," observed Panther. <br>
            She picked up a smooth oval-shaped egg. It was the size of a big grapefruit. There were at least twenty eggs. <br>
            "You mean," gasped Jane, "we're in a dinosaur's nest?" <br>
            "It looks that way," replied Cy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “爸爸？”&nbsp;那些蛋里传来了婴儿的声音。<br>
            “兰姆！”&nbsp;潘瑟开心地叫了出来。<br>
            兰姆不知道怎么来到了这个恐龙窝里。<br>
            “你还好吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟对她的弟弟表现出了不同以往的关心。<br>
            “妈妈！”&nbsp;兰姆笑着指向了潘瑟身后。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Dada?" a baby's voice called from among the eggs. <br>
            "Lamb!" Panther cried with joy. <br>
            Somehow Lamb had ended up in this dinosaur's nest. <br>
            "Are you okay?" Panther fussed over her brother. <br>
            "Mama!" Lamb smiled and pointed behind Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟转过身来，开始尖叫。一只恐龙正在朝着他们冲过来。它看上去非常生气。<br>
            “那是慈母龙。”&nbsp;赛伊浑身发抖地说。<br>
            “它以为我们要伤害它的孩子。”&nbsp;那只恐龙强壮的尾巴来回挥舞着。它锋利的爪子已经做好了攻击的准备。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther turned around and screamed. A dinosaur was heading toward the nest. She looked very angry. <br>
            "That's a Maiasaura," Cy said, trembling. "She thinks we're trying to harm her babies." <br>
            The dinosaur's strong tail swung back and forth. Her sharp claws were ready to attack.

            巴斯家的孩子们现在遇上了很大的麻烦。一只巨大而生气的慈母龙妈妈正准备攻击他们。<br>
            “有什么办法能出去吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟大叫道。<br>
            他们没办法从窝里爬出去。这个洞太深了。他们也没有地方躲。恐龙很快就会找到他们的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Barth children were in big trouble. A huge, angry mother Maiasaura was about to attack them. <br>
            "Is there any way out?" shouted Panther. <br>
            They could not climb out of the nest. It was too deep. They could not hide. The dinosaur would quickly find them.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “看！太阳要落山了！”&nbsp;简尖叫道。<br>
            “分散恐龙的注意力。太阳就要落山了！”&nbsp;赛伊喊了回去。<br>
            然后，他有了一个主意。<br>
            “它带走了兰姆但却没有伤害他。”&nbsp;他说。“也许它以为兰姆是它的孩子。”&nbsp;鲍比说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Look! The sun is about to set!" screamed Jane. <br>
            "Keep the dinosaur busy. The sun is going down!" Cy screamed back. <br>
            Then he had an idea. <br>
            "She took Lamb but didn't hurt him," he said. <br>
            "Maybe she thinks he's her baby," Bobby suggested.

            “这无所谓啦。”&nbsp;潘瑟叫道，“我们必须从这儿出去！”&nbsp;<br>
            潘瑟紧紧抓住了兰姆。恐龙发出了一声高喊。它更生气了。<br>
            “潘瑟！我们把宝宝传来传去！”&nbsp;赛伊叫道。<br>
            潘瑟没听明白。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It doesn't matter," yelled Panther. "We have to get out of here!" <br>
            Panther grabbed hold of Lamb. The dinosaur let out a high scream. She was angrier than ever. <br>
            "Panther! Keep passing the baby around!" Cy shouted. <br>
            Panther looked confused.
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “只要孩子在谁手里，那只恐龙就不会伤害谁。”&nbsp;他解释说。<br>
            潘瑟将兰姆递给了鲍比。鲍比迅速地将孩子递给了简。简又将他交给了赛伊。赛伊最后把兰姆又递给了潘瑟。孩子们就一直这样将兰姆传来传去。<br>
            兰姆咯咯笑着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The dinosaur won't harm whoever is holding him," he explained. <br>
            Panther gave Lamb to Bobby. Bobby quickly gave him to Jane. Jane passed him onto Cy. In turn, he gave Lamb back to Panther. The children kept passing Lamb around. <br>
            "Whee!" giggled Lamb.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他以为他们在玩儿游戏。恐龙停下来看着孩子们。它的小眼睛一直紧盯着兰姆，但它看上去有点儿困惑。<br>
            “快点，太阳！”&nbsp;赛伊祈祷着。<br>
            太阳就要开始落山了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He thought they were playing a game. The dinosaur stopped and looked at them. Her small eyes followed Lamb. But she looked confused. <br>
            "Come on, sun," prayed Cy. <br>
            The sun was just about to set.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            恐龙终于不耐烦了。它挥动着自己强壮的尾巴朝它的窝冲过来。越来越近了，孩子们都可以看到它尖尖的牙齿了。孩子们吓得瑟瑟发抖，紧紧地搂在一起。他们闭上了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally, the dinosaur was tired of the game. Swishing her powerful tail, she ran toward her nest. She was so close that the children saw her sharp teeth. Shaking with fear, the children hugged each other tightly. They closed their eyes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，孩子们意识到周围的一切都变得安静了。他们睁开了眼睛。<br>
            “它不见了！”&nbsp;鲍比叫道。<br>
            他们终于安全了。他们不再被巨大的生物包围着了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After a moment, the children realized everything was quiet. They opened their eyes.  <br>
            "She's gone!" shouted Bobby. <br>
            They were no longer in danger. And they were no longer among the giants.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们安全了！”&nbsp;简尖叫道。<br>
            孩子们开心得跳个不停。潘瑟擦去眼泪抱起了兰姆。重新回到正常世界的感觉真是太棒了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We're safe!" cried Jane. <br>
            The children jumped up and down with joy. Panther wiped away tears as she held Lamb. It felt wonderful to be back in her normal world again.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们最好回家吧。”&nbsp;赛伊抬头看着即将变黑的天空说，“玛莎阿姨可能担心了。”&nbsp;<br>
            他们回家的时候，玛莎阿姨刚好回来了。<br>
            “你过得愉快吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟问。<br>
            “是的，谢谢你们。”&nbsp;她回答，“你们今天过得怎么样？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We'd better get home," Cy said, looking up at the darkening sky. "Aunt Martha might be worried." <br>

            "Did you have a good time?" asked Panther. <br>

            玛莎阿姨笑了。她并不相信赛伊说的话。“你的想象力很棒。”&nbsp;她轻轻一笑，“我们现在去吃晚饭吧。”&nbsp;

            The children looked at each other and grinned. <br>

            “你不觉得我们应该停止了吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            “停止什么？”&nbsp;简问。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, the children woke up early. Since Aunt Martha was still asleep, they sat on the porch.<br>
            "Whose turn is it today?" Jane asked excitedly.<br>
            "Don't you think we should stop?" said Panther.<br>
            "Stop what?" asked Jane.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Making wishes," answered Panther. "It's not fun anymore."<br>
            The others thought about this matter. <br>
            "I have an idea," Cy said finally. "Each of us can make another wish. Then we promise to stop."

            除了潘瑟以外的每个人都同意说这是个好主意。<br>

            “对，这不公平！”&nbsp;简抱怨说。<br>
            最后，潘瑟让步了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone except Panther agreed this was a good plan. <br>

            Huey's fins opened and closed. They shone all different colors. But he was quiet. <br>
            "What's the matter, Huey?" asked Jane. <br>
            "I've never said anything before," he said, "but are you sure this is what you want?"

            休伊摇摇头，说：“不，简。当大人比你想的要困难得多，但这是你的愿望。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Huey looked really worried. <br>
            "I don't like being a child," Jane said. "People always tell you what to do. But grown-ups can do whatever they want." <br>
            Huey shook his head. "No, Jane. Being grown-up is harder than you think. But this is your wish."

            他的鳍暗了下来。然后，孩子们都感觉到手和腿一阵发痒。<br>
            “我在长大！”&nbsp;鲍比大叫道。他胖胖的小肚子不见了，而且他在不断地长高。<br>
            “快看我！”&nbsp;简叫道。她的头发颜色变深了，个子也变高了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            His fins turned dark. Then the children felt a tickling in their arms and legs. <br>
            "I'm growing!" Bobby shouted. His chubby stomach disappeared as he continued to grow tall. <br>
            "Look at me!" shouted Jane. Her hair turned darker as she also grew taller.

            潘瑟的眼镜不见了。她的脸变得更长了一些。<br>

            “赛伊胖了！”&nbsp;鲍比开玩笑说。<br>
            “闭嘴，鲍比。”&nbsp;赛伊嚷道。

            Panther's glasses disappeared and her face grew longer. <br>

            "Cy's fat!" teased Bobby. <br>
            "Shut up, Bobby," Cy yelled back.

            最后，孩子们感觉身上不痒了。他们停止了生长。现在，孩子们已经不再是孩子了。<br>

            他们看看彼此。赛伊和鲍比都穿上了西装。<br>
            “这条领带要勒死我了。”&nbsp;鲍比抱怨说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally the tickling feeling stopped. They had stopped growing. Now the children were no longer children. <br>

            They looked at each other. Cy and Bobby were wearing suits.<br>

            "We've all changed," Panther remarked.<br>

            “我知道。”&nbsp;简说。她的眼睛闪闪发光。“我们去喝咖啡吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们一直都想知道咖啡是什么味道。他们的父母和玛莎阿姨每天早上都会喝咖啡。<br>
            “咖啡是给大人喝的。”&nbsp;妈妈总是这么说。<br>
            “等你们再长大一点儿就可以喝了。”&nbsp;爸爸曾经说。

            "I know," said Jane, her eyes shining brightly. "Let's get coffee!" <br>

            "Coffee is for grown-ups," Mom had always said. <br>
            "Wait till you're older," Dad used to say.

            The grown-up Barths found a small coffee shop. They walked up to the counter and ordered four large coffees. <br>
            "Hey, Cy, can I have some cheesecake?" asked Bobby. <br>
            "You know what Mom said about sweets," Cy replied. <br>

            孩子们端着咖啡去了靠近窗户的一张桌子那里。他们刚一坐下，简就脱掉了高跟鞋。“怎么每个人都可以穿着这样的鞋走路啊？”&nbsp;她揉着自己的脚抱怨着。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Will there be anything else?" he asked. <br>
            "Uh, no, that's all," Cy said in his new, deep voice. <br>

            "Yuck!" Panther spit out the coffee she drank. "This is disgusting! How can Mom and Dad like this?" <br>
            The other children tried it, too. <br>
            "It tastes awful," agreed Cy. <br>
            The grown-up Barths wondered why adults drank that bitter black stuff.

            “我以前觉得当大人会很有意思。”&nbsp;简用力吸了口气，“我不知道当大人会这么难。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Barth kids were silent. They watched other children playing. <br>
            "They look so happy," said Bobby. "I wish I could ride a bike, too." <br>
            "I thought being a grown-up would be fun," Jane sniffed. "I didn't know it would be so hard."

            他们坐在长椅上，无事可做。赛伊看了看手表，说：“我们回玛莎阿姨家吧。”&nbsp;他说：“我们可以藏起来等日落。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Barths sat on the bench for a while. They didn't know what else to do. Then Cy looked at his watch. "Let's go back to Aunt Martha's," he said. "We can hide until the sun sets."

            简爬到了赛伊的背上。

            "I can't walk in these shoes anymore," cried Jane. She threw her heels on the ground. <br>

            Jane climbed onto Cy's back.

            When the Barths got home, it was getting dark. <br>

            “不，我知道。这个镇上的人都很刻薄，而且这里太无聊了！”&nbsp;鲍比继续说，“如果没有休伊的话，我们在这里根本没事情可做。”&nbsp;

            "Well, I think people here are just mean," said Bobby. "In Chicago, nobody would have said nasty things." <br>

            "Yes, I do. This town is full of mean people. And it's so boring!" Bobby continued. "If it weren't for Huey, we would have nothing to do."

            孩子们同意了鲍比的说法。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children agreed with him on that. <br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，孩子们出现了和早上一样四肢发痒的感觉。他们的胳膊和腿变短了。赛伊的肚子消失了。鲍比的小胖肚子却又长出来了。几分钟后，他们又恢复了孩子的样子。<br>
            “重新回到孩子的样子真好。”&nbsp;简说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly the Barths felt the same tickling feeling they had felt that morning. Their arms and legs got shorter. Cy's stomach disappeared while Bobby's reappeared. Within a few minutes, the Barths were once again children. <br>
            "It's good to be me again," said Jane.

            They gave each other hugs. <br>

            During dinner, Aunt Martha told them about her day. <br>
            "I took Lamb to the park," she said. "We saw these adults running around behaving like children."

            孩子们看了看彼此。<br>
            “我同意玛莎阿姨的说法。”&nbsp;简说，“我们的举止应该与我们的年龄相符。”&nbsp;

            "Maybe they just wanted to have fun," Cy said in a quiet voice. <br>

            第二天一早，孩子们做好了外出的准备。玛莎阿姨带着兰姆去了花园。<br>

            “我没有愿望啊。”&nbsp;他说，“我能明天再许愿吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            其他孩子想了想。然后，潘瑟说：“我们每人都可以跳过一次。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, the children got ready to go out. Aunt Martha took Lamb outside to the garden. <br>
            "It's your turn, Bobby," whispered Cy. <br>
            "I don't have a wish," he said. "Can I do it tomorrow?" <br>
            The others thought about it. Then Panther said, "We can all use a break."

            “那我们今天不去见休伊了。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            潘瑟读了一本书。简玩儿玩具。赛伊去骑车了。鲍比什么都没干。他不想出去，也不喜欢读书，更不想玩玩具。<br>
            “这里太无聊了。”&nbsp;他一直嘟囔着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So today we won't go see Huey," said Cy. <br>
            Panther read a book. Jane played with her dolls. Cy went for a bike ride. And Bobby did nothing. He didn't want to go outside. He hated reading. He didn't want to play with his toys. <br>
            "It's so boring here," he kept saying.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那你为什么不找点事情做呢？”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            “这里没事情可做啊。这个镇子太无聊了！”&nbsp;他抱怨说，“我想念芝加哥。那里总是有很多好玩儿的事情。”&nbsp;<br>
            “鲍比，我们最近有过很多次探险了。”&nbsp;潘瑟说，“你还觉得无聊吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why don't you do something then?" said Panther. <br>
            "There's nothing to do. This town is so boring!" he complained. "I miss Chicago. Something exciting always happens there." <br>
            "Bobby, we've had so many adventures lately," said Panther. "And you're still bored?"

            “我希望这里发生点有意思的事。在这儿，在镇子上。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            潘瑟转了转眼珠，然后又埋头去读书了。<br>
            突然，鲍比坐了起来打了个响指。“对了！”&nbsp;他叫道，“我知道我要许什么愿了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I want something exciting to happen here! Here in this town," said Bobby emotionally. <br>
            Panther rolled her eyes and returned to her book. <br>
            Suddenly Bobby sat up and snapped his fingers. "That's it!" he shouted. "I know what I'm going to wish for."

            第二天，鲍比的心情好多了。<br>

            “对，我终于读完我的书了。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            “我不用去担心恐龙的事情。也不用管那些刻薄的人。”&nbsp;简咯咯笑道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day, Bobby was in a better mood. <br>
            "It was nice not having a wish yesterday," said Cy. <br>
            "Yeah, I finally finished my book," said Panther. <br>
            "I didn't have to worry about dinosaurs or mean people," giggled Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好，我今天准备好许愿了。”&nbsp;鲍比激动地说。<br>
            因为某些原因，其他人并没有那么积极。但他们还是去了休伊的那口井。赛伊把他拉上来的时候，休伊并没有马上从壳里出来。孩子们不得不轻轻敲了敲他的壳。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, I'm ready to make my wish today," Bobby said excitedly. <br>
            For some reason, the others did not feel as eager. But they went to Huey's well. When Cy pulled him up, Huey did not come out right away. They had to tap lightly on his shell.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦！是你们啊！我以为你们不会再来了呢。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            赛伊解释说他们前一天没有想出什么愿望。<br>
            “但今天我有愿望了。”&nbsp;鲍比满脸笑容地说。“我希望，”&nbsp;他用戏剧性的语调说，“我们的镇上发生一些有趣的事情。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, it's you! I thought you weren't coming back," Huey said when he appeared. <br>
            Cy explained that they hadn't come up with a wish the previous day. <br>
            "But today I have," beamed Bobby. "I wish," he said dramatically, "that something exciting would happen in our town."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Of course," Aunt Martha said. "Then we can get new shoes for Lamb."<br>
            "Shoes?" Bobby almost shouted. This day did not sound exciting at all.<br>
            The children walked with Aunt Martha to the bank. Bobby walked behind the others and dragged his feet.

            The guard at the bank greeted them. "Good morning, everyone." <br>
            "Good morning," they said in return. <br>
            The bank was quite busy that morning. Aunt Martha, holding Lamb, went to stand in line.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们可以在长椅这等我。”&nbsp;她告诉孩子们。<br>
            孩子们在木头椅子上坐下了。他们看看四周。鲍比看到了那个店主，基弗先生。他还看到了贝克尔先生。鲍比又朝银行外面看去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You can wait for me on those benches," she told the children. <br>
            The children sat on hard wooden benches. They looked around. Bobby noticed Mr. Keefer, the shop owner. He also saw Mr. Becker. Bobby glanced outside.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            贝尔克先生的狗西尔弗被拴在了一个消防栓上。就在这时，四个男人在银行门前停下了。他们看上去很紧张。一个男人的脸上有道伤疤。另一个则扎着马尾。<br>
            “我在想他们是不是丢东西了。”&nbsp;鲍比大声说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mr. Becker's dog, Silver, was tied to a fire hydrant. At that moment, four men stopped in front of the bank. They looked nervous. One man had a scar on his face. Another man had a ponytail. <br>
            "I wonder if they're lost," Bobby said aloud.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，他们就快的像闪电一般拉下了戴在头上的面具。鲍比张大了嘴，但却什么也说不出来。那几个男人拿着枪走进了银行。<br>
            “女士们，先生们！”&nbsp;一个男人平静地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then quick as lightning, they pulled masks over their heads. Bobby opened his mouth but no sounds came out. The men entered the bank holding guns. <br>
            "Ladies and gentlemen," one man said in a calm voice.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            银行里的顾客都转过身来。当他们看到那些带着面具的男人时，有人开始尖叫。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The bank customers turned around. When they saw the masked men, some began screaming. <br>
            "Everybody, stay calm. Do not scream!" the man said, holding his gun up.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这时，另一个男人把警卫的双手绑在了背后，嘴上也贴上了胶带。第三个的男人锁上了银行的大门。他快速拉下了每扇窗子的百叶帘。第四个男人则跳到了出纳员的身后。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Meanwhile, another man tied the guard's hands behind his back. He put tape over his mouth too. A third man locked the bank doors. He rushed around pulling down the blinds. The fourth man jumped behind the tellers.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “别按警铃！”&nbsp;他警告他们说。“我希望每个人都到这里来。”&nbsp;第一个男人说。他指着孩子们坐的地方。“然后，趴到地上。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Do not push the alarm!" he warned them. <br>

            "Please, there are children here," a woman cried. It was Aunt Martha. <br>

            鲍比在地板上只能看到强盗们的脚。有两个男人穿着运动鞋。其中一只运动鞋上有个大洞。鲍比可以看到那个男人穿的袜子。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            From the floor, Bobby could see only the robbers' feet. Two of the men wore sneakers. One of the sneakers had a large hole in it. Bobby could see the socks of the man wearing it. They were blue with red stripes.

            “把你们的钱和首饰都放到这个袋子里。”&nbsp;穿着红蓝杠袜子的强盗在人们面前扔下了一个袋子。人们掏出了自己的钱包和皮夹。有些取下了自己的手表。强盗们还拿走了戒指、项链和耳环。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Put all your money and jewelry in this bag." The robber with blue socks dropped a bag in front of the people. They removed their purses and wallets. Some took off their watches. The robbers also took rings, necklaces, and earrings.

            孩子们看着太阳落山了。一阵急促的敲门声吓了他们一跳。赛伊打开了门，是农夫詹金斯。<br>
            “我拿来了一些自家做的果酱给我们的英雄。”&nbsp;他微笑着说。<br>
            “啊？”&nbsp;鲍比一脸困惑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children watched as the sun disappeared. A sharp knock on the door startled them. Cy opened the door. It was Farmer Jenkins. <br>
            "I brought some homemade jam for our heroes," he said, smiling. <br>
            "Huh?" Bobby was confused.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “为什么？”&nbsp;潘瑟小心地问。她还记得他们欠农夫詹金斯多少果酱。<br>
            “因为你们帮忙抓住了强盗。”&nbsp;詹金斯轻声笑着说，“我希望你们喜欢这些果酱。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What for?" asked Panther cautiously. She still remembered how much jam they owed Farmer Jenkins. <br>
            "For helping to catch the robbers," the farmer chuckled. "I hope you kids enjoy this."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他把果酱罐递给赛伊后就走了。孩子们有些羞愧地看着那些果酱。<br>
            “他为什么会记得抢劫的事情？”&nbsp;鲍比依然觉得困惑。他看着外面漆黑的天空问。“休伊说太阳落山之后，一切都会回到原样的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He handed the jars to Cy then waved good-bye. The children looked at the jam guiltily. <br>
            "Why did he remember the robbery?" Bobby was still confused, looking outside at the dark. "Huey said everything returns to normal once the sun sets."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            没人可以解释这件事情。<br>
            第二天一早，孩子们就去见休伊了。赛伊刚把休伊从井里拉上来，鲍比就抛出了一连串的问题。“哇哈！”&nbsp;休伊抬起了手，“你再说一次，你的愿望是什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            No one could explain it. <br>
            Early the next morning, the children went to see Huey. As soon as Cy pulled him up, Bobby started to throw out questions. <br>
            "Whoa!" Huey held up his hand. "What exactly was your wish again?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望发生一些好玩儿的事情。”&nbsp;鲍比回答说。<br>
            “然后呢，事情发生了吗？”&nbsp;休伊问。<br>
            “昨天发生了一场银行抢劫。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“那很可怕，不好玩儿。”&nbsp;<br>
            “还发生了其它的事情吗？”&nbsp;休伊问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "For something exciting to happen," answered Bobby. <br>
            "And did it?" Huey asked. <br>
            "There was a bank robbery," said Bobby. "It was more kind of scary than exciting." <br>
            "What else happened?" Huey asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们见到了很多以前不认识的人。”&nbsp;赛伊说。<br>
            “也许银行抢劫并不是你们的愿望。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            “我不明白。”&nbsp;鲍比说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We got to meet many new people," said Cy. <br>
            "So maybe the bank robbery wasn't the wish," said Huey. <br>
            "I don't understand," said Bobby.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “认识新的人感觉怎么样？”&nbsp;休伊问。<br>
            孩子们陷入了思考。最后鲍比回答。“有儿点意思。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How did it feel to meet new people?" asked Huey. <br>
            The children were thoughtful. Finally Bobby answered. "It was kind of exciting," he said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “也许这才是你的愿望。”&nbsp;休伊像魔术师一样张开了双手。<br>
            “但这个愿望昨天就结束了。”&nbsp;简说。<br>
            “他们现在就不是我们的朋友了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “那要看你们的了。”&nbsp;休伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Maybe that was your wish." Huey spread his hands like a magician. <br>
            "But the wish ended yesterday," said Jane. "Will they stop being our friends now?" <br>
            "That depends on you," said Huey.

            孩子们围在井边，一言不发。他们已经同意了各自许两个愿望。现在只有潘瑟剩下一个愿望可以许了。<br>
            “你们要在这里站上一整天吗？”&nbsp;休伊说。他的声音听上去有点儿不高兴了。<br>
            赛伊用胳膊肘推了推潘瑟。“轮到你了。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children stood around Huey's well without speaking. They had agreed to make two wishes each. Only Panther had one wish left. <br>
            "Are you going to stand there all day?" Huey said, sounding irritated. <br>
            Cy nudged Panther. "It's your turn," he said.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟点点头，但却没有说话。<br>

            潘瑟依然没有说话。<br>
            鲍比大声叹了一口气。<br>
            简轻轻地用脚踢了一下。赛伊转了转脑袋。他们显然都有点儿烦了，但没人说话。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther nodded but didn't say anything. <br>
            "Are you running out of wishes?" Huey asked. <br>
            Panther still did not speak. <br>
            Bobby let out a loud sigh. Jane tapped her foot. Cy kept turning his head. Clearly they were all annoyed. But no one said a word.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望每个人都可以说出他心里想的话。”&nbsp;潘瑟突然不假思索地说。<br>
            休伊的鳍开始一开一合。<br>
            潘瑟用手捂住了嘴。<br>
            “不，休伊。那不是一个愿望。”&nbsp;她叫道。<br>
            “但你许愿了啊！”&nbsp;休伊说。他的鳍变成了紫色和蓝色。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wish everyone would say what they are thinking," Panther blurted out. <br>
            Huey's fins started to open and close. Panther put her hand over her mouth. <br>
            "No, Huey. That wasn't a wish," she cried. <br>
            "But you wished it," Huey said, his fins turning purple and blue.

            “我的意思是……”&nbsp;潘瑟试图解释，<br>

            “现在离开这里吧。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            赛伊将休伊放到了木桶里。当他慢慢把休伊送回井底时，赛伊轻声说：“我真的厌倦了每次都做这件事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What I meant was . . ." Panther tried to explain. <br>
            But it was too late. Huey granted her wish. <br>
            "Now go away," he said. <br>
            Cy placed Huey in the bucket. As he lowered him down, Cy muttered, "I'm sick of doing this every time."

            他的兄弟姐妹们盯着他。赛伊猛地用手捂住了嘴。“我为什么说出来了？”&nbsp;他惊奇地说。<br>
            “那是因为你很刻薄。”&nbsp;简喊道。她随后也用手捂住了嘴。<br>
            孩子们突然感觉面对彼此很尴尬。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            His siblings stared at him. Cy slapped a hand over his mouth. "Why did I say that?" he said in a surprised voice. <br>
            "That's because you're mean," Jane cried out. She, too, then covered her mouth. <br>
            The children suddenly felt uneasy with each other.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我觉得我们应该回家了。”&nbsp;潘瑟建议说。<br>
            孩子们走出了森林。<br>
            潘瑟领头走着。她有很多事情需要思考。突然，赛伊从后面叫住了她：“你能不能慢一点？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I think we should go home," Panther suggested. <br>
            The children headed out of the woods. Panther walked ahead of the others. She had much to think about. Suddenly, Cy called out from behind, "Will you slow down?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟转头嚷道：“你干吗不走快点？你真慢！"<br>
            “真慢？你说谁慢？”&nbsp;赛伊叫嚷着，“你总是觉得你比我们都强！”&nbsp;“对，我本来就是！”&nbsp;潘瑟叫嚷着回击。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther spun her head around and shouted: "Why don't you walk faster? You're such a slowpoke!" <br>
            "Slowpoke? Who are you calling slow?" yelled Cy. "You always think you're better than us!" <br>
            "Well, I am!" Panther shouted back.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你俩都住嘴！”&nbsp;鲍比爆发了。<br>
            潘瑟和赛伊都吃惊地盯着他们的弟弟。<br>
            “你让我住嘴？”&nbsp;赛伊生气地问道。<br>
            “对！你俩就像两只猴子！”&nbsp;鲍比叫着。<br>
            “你看上去才像只猴子呢！”&nbsp;简对着鲍比大嚷。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Shut up, both of you!" exploded Bobby. <br>
            Stunned, Panther and Cy stared at their younger brother. <br>
            "Did you tell me to shut up?" Cy said in a low, angry voice. <br>
            "Yes! You're acting like two baboons!" Bobby shouted. <br>
            "You're the one who looks like a monkey," Jane yelled at Bobby.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快四个孩子都相互叫骂了起来。<br>
            “所以这才是你们对我真正的看法。”&nbsp;潘瑟哭了。<br>
            “我还以为你们关心我。”&nbsp;鲍比大喊。<br>
            过了一会儿，孩子们都没话要说了。<br>
            “这是最糟糕的愿望。”&nbsp;简抽着鼻子说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon all four children were shouting and screaming at each other. <br>
            "So this is how you really feel about me," wept Panther. <br>
            "I thought you cared about me," cried Bobby. <br>
            After a while, the children ran out of things to say. <br>
            "This is the worst wish ever," sniffed Jane.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            潘瑟一句话都没说，因为在她的心里也是同意的。孩子们相互不再说话，都沉默着继续往家走。当他们接近镇子的时候，孩子们听到了到处都在尖叫。<br>
            “我讨厌你！”&nbsp;基弗先生对着一个年轻女人嚷嚷着。<br>
            “好，我也从来没有喜欢过你！”&nbsp;那个女人反击道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Panther didn't say anything because in her heart she agreed. Without speaking to one another, they all continued to walk. As they got closer to town, the children heard shouting everywhere. <br>
            "I don't like you!" shouted Mr. Keefer to a young woman. <br>
            "Well, I never liked you either!" she shouted back.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，孩子们看到了带着兰姆的玛莎阿姨。她在和农夫詹金斯的妻子说话。<br>
            “你的发型太丑了！”&nbsp;詹金斯夫人说。<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨摸了摸头发。“好吧，&nbsp;你的裙子看上去就像渔夫！”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then the children spotted Aunt Martha with Lamb. She was speaking with Farmer Jenkins' wife. <br>
            "Your hairstyle is ugly!" Mrs. Jenkins said. <br>
            "What?" Aunt Martha touched her hair. "Well, you dress like a fisherman!" she said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，是吗？那总比你穿的像个老太太好！”&nbsp;詹金斯夫人大叫。<br>
            这两个女人看上去就要打起来了。潘瑟向他们跑过去。“你们不是那个意思的。”&nbsp;她恳求地说，“你们两个是朋友啊。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, really? It's better than dressing like an old lady!" Mrs. Jenkins shouted. <br>
            The two women looked as if they were going to wrestle. Panther ran up to them. "You don't mean that," she said in a pleading voice. "You two are friends."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “她才不是我的朋友！”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨大声说。<br>
            “她绝对不是我朋友！”&nbsp;詹金斯夫人叫嚷着回击。<br>
            潘瑟的眼里充满了泪水。<br>
            “哦，我都干了些什么？”&nbsp;她哀叹道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "She's no friend of mine!" yelled Aunt Martha. <br>
            "She's certainly not my friend!" Mrs. Jenkins shot back. <br>
            Panther's eyes filled with tears. <br>
            "Oh, what have I done?" she moaned.

            Panther thought about what she had just said. "You only think good things about people," she said to Lamb. <br>
            That gave her an idea. <br>

            "What is it, child?" Aunt Martha asked sharply.

            “哦，你们这些孩子有时很烦人。”&nbsp;玛莎阿姨真心地说，“但至少你们很懂礼貌。”&nbsp;

            潘瑟走向了赛伊和鲍比。“你们就没有什么好话能说吗？”&nbsp;她问自己的兄弟。鲍比固执地抱着胳膊摇头。赛伊将脑袋转到一边，对鲍比视而不见。<br>

            Panther went over to Cy and Bobby. "Don't you have anything nice to say?" she asked her brothers. Bobby crossed his arms stubbornly and shook his head. Cy turned his head and ignored him. <br>
            "Look into your hearts," she said to her siblings. "I'm sure you'll find good things, not just bad."

            镇上的一些居民停止了争吵去听潘瑟说话。<br>
            “真心表达自己并不意味着要成为被人讨厌的人。”&nbsp;她继续说。

            The children looked at each other. Bobby stuck his tongue out at Cy. <br>
            Panther sighed loudly and said: "People should say what they think. But what if we thought only nice things?" <br>
            Some of the townspeople stopped to listen to Panther. <br>
            "Being honest doesn't mean being nasty," she continued.

            Bobby glanced at Cy. Cy gave him a quick smile. <br>

            第二天早上，巴斯家的孩子们感觉好多了，但他们依然非常想念自己的父母。他们的爸爸妈妈已经离开一周了。当然，他们每晚都会打电话过来，但这跟爸爸妈妈真的在身边还是不一样的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, the Barth children were feeling much better. Still, they missed their parents very much. It was over a week since Mom and Dad had left. Of course they called every night. But it wasn't the same.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望妈妈和爸爸能快点儿回来。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>

            实际上，在他心里，他也很想念爸爸妈妈。<br>
            “我希望他今天就能找到工作。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I hope Mom and Dad come home soon," said Bobby. <br>
            "I miss them so much," Jane said, almost in tears. <br>
            "Dad has to find a job first," said Cy bravely. Inside, he, too, missed his parents. <br>
            "I wish he would find one today," said Panther.

            这几个孩子几乎是同时抬起了眼睛。<br>

            “休伊。”&nbsp;鲍比小声说。<br>
            “但我们不能再许愿了。”&nbsp;潘瑟分辨说，“我们每个人都许过两个愿了。结束了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Almost at the same time, the children looked up. <br>
            "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" asked Cy. <br>
            "Huey," Bobby said under his breath. <br>
            "But we said no more wishes," argued Panther. "Each of us got two wishes. That's it!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但这次不一样。”&nbsp;赛伊说，“这不是为了我们。这是为了妈妈和爸爸。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们思考着。“而且我们还没有向休伊告别呢。”&nbsp;简补充道。<br>
            “你说的对。”&nbsp;潘瑟承认了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But this is different," said Cy. "It's not for us. It's for Mom and Dad." <br>

            "And we didn't say good-bye to Huey," added Jane. <br>
            "That's true," admitted Panther.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是，孩子们又一次出发去见休伊了。赛伊和往常一样把木桶降到了井底，但他用了更长时间才找到休伊的壳。最终，赛伊找到了休伊并把他拉了上来。<br>
            “你躲在哪儿了，休伊？”&nbsp;这个神奇生物出现的时候赛伊问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So the children set out to see Huey once again. Cy lowered the bucket as usual. But it took longer to locate Huey's shell. Finally Cy found him and pulled him up. <br>
            "Where were you, Huey?" asked Cy when the magical creature appeared.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “就是忙一些事情。”&nbsp;休伊回答。他避开了孩子们的眼睛。<br>
            休伊看上去和他以前的样子有点儿不同了，但孩子们不敢问他遇到了什么事情。<br>
            “今天轮到谁了？”&nbsp;休伊说。他恢复了平常的声音。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Just busy with something," Huey answered, avoiding their eyes. <br>
            Huey seemed different from his usual self. But the children were afraid to ask if something had happened to him. <br>
            "Whose turn is it today?" Huey said, his voice back to normal.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们看看彼此，然后赛伊回答说：“哦，这是我们大家的愿望。”&nbsp;他指着自己的兄弟姐妹还有自己。<br>
            休伊看上去很吃惊：“这很少见啊。那你们的愿望是什么呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们希望爸爸能找到工作。”&nbsp;赛伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children looked at each other. Then Cy answered, "Well, it's our wish." He pointed to his siblings and himself. <br>
            Huey looked surprised. "That's unusual. What is your wish, then?" <br>
            "We wish our dad would find a job," said Cy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “然后快点回家。”&nbsp;简补充说。<br>
            “但是，你们知道规矩的。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            他盯着孩子们发愣的脸：“愿望的有效期只有一天，还记得吗？”&nbsp;他提醒他们说。<br>
            “哦，是啊。”&nbsp;他们伤心地回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And hurry and come home," added Jane. <br>
            "But you know the rules," said Huey. <br>
            He stared at the children's blank faces. "The wish is granted for only one day, remember?" he reminded them. <br>
            "Oh, yeah," they replied sadly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但这真的是我们最最想实现的愿望啊。”&nbsp;鲍比恳求说，“其它愿望都是为了好玩儿。这个是真的愿望。”&nbsp;<br>
            “对啊，这个是真正的愿望。”&nbsp;简说。<br>
            休伊慢慢地摇摇头：“我很抱歉，孩子们，但规矩就是规矩。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But this is the only wish we really, really want," pleaded Bobby. "The other wishes were for fun. This is for real." <br>
            "Yeah, this is a real wish," said Jane. <br>
            Huey shook his head slowly. "I'm sorry, children. But rules are rules."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            休伊的鳍开始闪烁光芒。这次的颜色比以往都要多，但孩子们太伤心了，都没有注意到。<br>
            “好了，休伊。我们明白了。”&nbsp;最后，赛伊说。<br>
            “那我们就没有别的愿望了。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            赛伊轻轻地将休伊放回了木桶里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Huey's fins started to glow and shine. The colors were more beautiful than ever. But the children were too sad to notice. <br>
            "Okay, Huey. We understand," Cy said finally. <br>
            "Then we don't have any more wishes," said Panther. <br>
            Cy gently placed Huey back into the bucket.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “开心点吧。”&nbsp;休伊说，“我敢肯定，你们的爸爸妈妈很快就回家了。”&nbsp;<br>
            说完这句话，休伊就消失在了他的壳里。赛伊再一次将他送回了井底。<br>
            孩子们带着沉重的心走回了家，脸色也很难看。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Cheer up," said Huey. "I'm sure your parents will be home soon." <br>
            With that he disappeared into his shell. Cy lowered him down once again. <br>
            With heavy hearts, the children walked back home. They spent the rest of the day with long faces.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道什么能让咱们高兴起来。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            孩子们坐在门廊里吃着零食。“我们应该为每个人烤点饼干。”&nbsp;<br>
            “为什么？”&nbsp;鲍比问。他的嘴里塞满了花生酱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I know what will cheer us up," Panther said. The children were sitting on the porch eating a snack. "We should bake cookies for everyone." <br>
            "What for?" asked Bobby, his mouth full of peanut butter.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，在遇到休伊之后，发生了这么多事情。”&nbsp;潘瑟继续说，“我们的愿望影响了其他人。”&nbsp;<br>
            “玛莎阿姨、贝克尔先生和西尔弗。”&nbsp;简数着数，“还有农夫詹金斯。”&nbsp;<br>
            “而且我们交了很多朋友。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, after meeting Huey, so many things happened," Panther continued. "Our wishes affected other people." <br>
            "Aunt Martha, Mr. Becker and Silver," Jane counted, "and Farmer Jenkins." <br>
            "And we made a lot of friends," said Panther.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这想法不错。”&nbsp;赛伊开心地说。<br>
            于是，孩子们烤了很多饼干。当然，玛莎阿姨和兰姆也帮了忙。屋外天色开始变暗了。<br>
            “我们可以明天拿这些饼干去送给每个人。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。<br>
            突然，响起了敲门声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's a great idea," Cy said happily. <br>
            So the children baked lots of cookies. Of course Aunt Martha and Lamb helped too. Outside it was getting dark. <br>
            "We can take the cookies to everyone tomorrow," said Panther. <br>
            Suddenly there was a knock on the door.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我去开门。”&nbsp;简说。<br>
            “我在想会是谁呢？”&nbsp;鲍比一边问，一边又从盘子里拿了一块饼干。<br>
            “惊喜哦！”&nbsp;两个熟悉的声音大声叫道。那是妈妈和爸爸，他们回来了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'll get it," said Jane. <br>
            "I wonder who it can be?" asked Bobby as he took another cookie from a plate. <br>

            Mom and Dad had returned.

            "Hurry and pack, kids," he called to them. "We don't have a lot of time." <br>
            The children stared at the boxes beside the car. Suddenly Panther gasped. "We didn't say good-bye to Huey!" she whispered.

            孩子们朝着树林跑去。<br>
            “你们要去哪里啊？”&nbsp;爸爸叫道。<br>
            “我们去跟一个朋友道别！”&nbsp;赛伊大声回答。<br>
            孩子们并没有停下。他们一直跑到了休伊的井边。赛伊赶快将木桶放了下去。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children began running toward the woods. <br>
            "Where are you going?" Dad shouted. <br>
            "To say good-bye to a friend!" Cy yelled back. <br>
            The children did not stop until they got to Huey's well. Cy hurriedly lowered the bucket down.

            他又一次费了很大功夫才找到休伊的壳。最后，他还是把休伊拉了上来。就像昨天一样，休伊看上去有点儿不同了。他甚至对着孩子们微笑了。<br>
            “你们是来许最后一个愿望的吗？”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “最后一个愿望？你要去哪里吗？”&nbsp;潘瑟问。

            Once again, he struggled to find Huey's shell. Finally he pulled Huey up. As he had the day before, Huey seemed different. He even smiled at the children.<br>
            "Did you come to make your last wish?" he said. <br>
            "Last wish? Are you going somewhere?" asked Panther.

            “我以为你们要走了。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            “你怎么知道的？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>
            休伊再次微笑着说：“我们奥伦族知道我们需要知道的一切。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I thought you were leaving," Huey said. <br>
            "How did you know?" asked Bobby. <br>
            Huey smiled again and said, "We Orlanes know what we need to know."

            “休伊。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。她的声音开始哽咽了：“我们会想你的。”&nbsp;<br>
            其他人也伤心地点头。<br>
            “谢谢你实现了我们的愿望。”&nbsp;赛伊感激地说。<br>
            “我们很抱歉，但我们没有什么能给你的。”&nbsp;简哭了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Huey," Panther said, her voice choking, "we're going to miss you." <br>
            The others nodded sadly. <br>
            "Thank you for making our wishes come true," Cy said gratefully. <br>
            "We're sorry but we don't have anything to give you," Jane cried.

            “我们烤了一些饼干。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“但我们把它们都送出去了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “饼干？”&nbsp;休伊做了个鬼脸，“我很高兴你们没有把饼干给我。我不喜欢人类的食物。”&nbsp;然后，他更温柔地看着每个孩子：“但谢谢你们想到我。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We baked some cookies," said Bobby. "But we gave them all away." <br>
            "Cookies?" Huey made a face. "I'm glad you didn't give them to me. I don't like human food." Then he looked at each child more gently. "But thank you for thinking of me."

            “我们还能来看你吗？”&nbsp;简满怀希望地问。<br>
            “恐怕不行了。”&nbsp;休伊说着摇摇头，“因为，我也要离开了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “离开？”&nbsp;孩子们大喊，“去哪里啊？”&nbsp;<br>
            “去我的下一站。”&nbsp;休伊回答。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can we come to visit you sometime?" Jane asked hopefully. <br>
            "I'm afraid not," said Huey, shaking his head. "For I, too, am leaving." <br>
            "Leaving?" cried the children. "Where?" <br>
            "To my next destination," Huey replied.

            “那我们怎么才能找到你呢？”&nbsp;简哭了。她完全不在意眼泪从脸上滚落。<br>
            休伊的鳍开始一开一合。他的脑袋从一边转到另一边。然后，他的整个身体都开始发光，很亮很亮。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How can we find you?" Jane cried, not caring that tears were falling down her face. <br>
            Huey's fins began to open and close. His head moved from side to side. Then his whole body glowed brightly.

            “总有一天。”&nbsp;他说。“你们会遇到另一口井的。你们朝里看，也许我就在那里。但是，”&nbsp;他继续说道，“在你们的心灵更深处去寻找。你们就一定会找到我的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们会想你的，休伊。”&nbsp;孩子们流着泪说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "One day," he said, "you may come across another well. Look inside and perhaps I may be there. But," he continued, "search deeper in your hearts. And you will find me for sure." <br>
            "We're going to miss you, Huey," the children said, weeping.

            他们站在那里哭着，没人说话。最后，赛伊开口了。<br>
            “我想我们必须得走了。”&nbsp;他抽着鼻子说。<br>
            “不过别忘了把我放回井里去。”&nbsp;休伊说。<br>
            赛伊充满爱地捧起了休伊的壳，把它轻轻地放到了木桶里。

            They stood there in tears for a few minutes. Nobody said a word. Finally, Cy spoke up. <br>
            "I think we have to go," he said, sniffling. <br>
            "Just don't forget to lower me back down," Huey said. <br>
            Cy lovingly lifted Huey's shell. He gently placed it inside the bucket.

            “再见，赛伊，潘瑟，鲍比，还有简！”&nbsp;休伊挥着手说。<br>
            “再见，休伊！”&nbsp;孩子们大叫道。<br>
            赛伊最后一次将木桶放回了井里。孩子们看着休伊的壳消失在了那个黑黑的洞里。<br>
            就在孩子们转身准备回家的时候，潘瑟说：“我还有最后一个愿望。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Good-bye, Cy! Panther! Bobby and Jane!" Huey waved. <br>
            "Good-bye, Huey!" cried the children. <br>
            Then for the last time Cy lowered the bucket down the well. The children watched as Huey's shell disappeared down the dark hole. <br>
            "I have one last wish," said Panther, as the children turned to go home.

            “你的愿望是什么？”&nbsp;简问。<br>
            “我希望休伊一切都好。我希望他去任何地方都能找到快乐。”&nbsp;潘瑟说。

            "What is it?" asked Jane. <br>
            "I wish the best for Huey. I wish he finds happiness wherever he goes," Panther said.

            “你怎么知道这个愿望会成真呢？”&nbsp;简问。<br>

            巴斯家的孩子们手牵着手走出了森林。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How do you know it will come true?" asked Jane. <br>
            "Because the best wishes in life are those you make for others," replied Panther. <br>
            Hand in hand, the Barth children walked out of the woods.
