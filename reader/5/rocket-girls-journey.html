        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一天早上，乐购超市的两个工作人员正在给货架上货。<br>
            “梅格，我们的罐装番茄酱太多了。”&nbsp;一个工作人员看了看箱子说，“货架上放不下。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那就放在收银台旁边吧。”&nbsp;梅格说，“我们得快点儿，超市马上要开门了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was early morning, and two workers at Shopwell Supermarket were stocking shelves.<br>
            "We have too many canned tomatoes, Meg," one worker said, looking in boxes. "They won't fit on the shelf."<br>
            "Let's stack them near the cash registers," Meg said. "We need to hurry—the store opens soon."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们搬着箱子走在过道上，梅格发现一些货架空着。“我们刚才明明把这里的货架都放满了，食物都去哪儿了？”&nbsp;<br>
            达里尔的脚下嘎吱一声，他低头一看，面包屑和包装纸散落在地板上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As they carried the boxes down an aisle, Meg spotted some empty shelves. "I'm sure that we stocked those shelves earlier. Where did all the food go?"<br>
            Something crunched under Daryl's foot, and he looked down. Crumbs and wrappers were scattered across the floor.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是你一直在吃东西吗，达里尔？”&nbsp;梅格放下箱子问。<br>
            “当然不是！”&nbsp;达里尔回答。<br>
            “那是谁在吃东西？”&nbsp;<br>
            哼哼！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Have you been eating stuff, Daryl?" Meg asked, putting down her box.<br>
            "Of course not!" Daryl replied.<br>
            "Then who's been eating?"<br>
            Snort!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            达里尔吓了一跳，箱子掉在了地上。“那是什么声音？”&nbsp;<br>
            梅格指了指过道的尽头，他们小心翼翼地往那边走去。<br>
            哼哼！突然一个巨大的身影跳了出来。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;梅格和达里尔跑开了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Startled, Daryl dropped his boxes. "What was that noise?"<br>
            Meg gestured toward the end of the aisle, and they tiptoed toward the sound.<br>
            Snort! Suddenly a large figure leaped out.<br>
            "Ahh!" Meg and Daryl ran.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “杰克，你在做什么？”&nbsp;艾普卡特老师皱了皱眉。<br>
            杰克在地板上爬着：“我的铅笔从桌子上掉下来了。”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西捡起铅笔：“给你。”&nbsp;<br>
            老师双臂交叉，表情很严厉：“你应该安静地看书，而不是找铅笔。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Jack, what are you doing?" Teacher Apricot asked with a frown.<br>
            Jack was crawling on the floor. "My pencil rolled off my desk."<br>
            Roxy reached down. "Here it is."<br>
            The teacher folded her arms and gave Jack a stern look. "You're supposed to be reading quietly—not searching for your pencil."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            杰克坐下来，转着他的铅笔：“我的书没意思，真希望现在是休息时间。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我的书很有意思。”&nbsp;特勒尔说，“是讲丝绸之路的。”&nbsp;<br>
            玛拉叹了口气。<br>
            “你的书也没意思吗？”&nbsp;罗西问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Jack sat down and spun his pencil around. "My book is boring. I wish it was time for recess."<br>
            "I'm enjoying my book," Terrell said. "It's about the Silk Road."<br>
            Mara sighed.<br>
            "Is your book boring too?" Roxy asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “书挺有意思的，不过我太饿了。”&nbsp;玛拉说。<br>
            “好想快点吃午饭，今天吃披萨。”&nbsp;特勒尔说。<br>
            “嗯，我都闻到香味了。”&nbsp;玛拉说。<br>
            杰克吸了吸鼻子：“我也闻到了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My book is pretty interesting, but I'm so hungry," Mara said.<br>
            "I can't wait for lunch—it's Pizza Day," Terrell said.<br>
            "Mmm, I can smell it," Mara said.<br>
            Jack sniffed. "I can smell it too!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            艾普卡特老师皱了皱眉：“嘘！”&nbsp;<br>
            杰克不好意思地笑了笑：“对不起！”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西的手表响了。“艾普卡特老师，我要……嗯……去一下洗手间。”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西跑到走廊上，她打开手表：“布洛姆市长，怎么了？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Teacher Apricot frowned. "Shh!"<br>
            Jack grinned sheepishly. "Sorry!"<br>
            Roxy's watch beeped. "I'll be right back, Miss Apricot. I need to, um, use the restroom."<br>
            Roxy ran into the hallway and opened her watch. "Mayor Bloom. What's wrong?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “火箭女孩儿。”&nbsp;布洛姆市长说，“美罗城有一个偷食物的小偷。”&nbsp;<br>
            “偷食物的小偷？”&nbsp;罗西问。<br>
            布洛姆市长点了点头：“小偷没付钱就吃了食物。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我会去看看，市长。不过，我一直都是和危险的坏人战斗，而不是和那些吃了一顿饭不付钱的人。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Rocket Girl," Mayor Bloom said, "there's a food thief in Metro City."<br>
            "A food thief?" Roxy asked.<br>
            Mayor Bloom nodded. "The thief is eating food without paying for it."<br>
            "I'll check it out, Mayor. But I usually fight dangerous villains—not somebody who ate a meal and didn't pay."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那个小偷不是只吃了一顿饭。”&nbsp;布洛姆市长说，“他把乐购超市里的所有食物都吃光了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “天呐！”&nbsp;罗西大吃一惊。<br>
            “然后，他还把另外两家食品店和几家餐厅的食物也都吃光了。”&nbsp;布洛姆市长摇了摇头，“他现在在美罗城面包店。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The thief didn't just eat a meal," Mayor Bloom said. "He ate all the food at Shopwell Supermarket!"<br>
            "Whoa!" Roxy gasped.<br>
            "Then he ate all the food in two other food stores and several restaurants." Mayor Bloom shook his head. "He's in Metro City Bakery now."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那个小偷听起来像个超级大胃王。”&nbsp;罗西说，“别担心，市长。我马上出发！”&nbsp;<br>
            当罗西到达时，警察已经包围了美罗城面包店。史密斯侦探正站在一辆警车后面观察。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The thief sounds like some sort of super eater," Roxy said. "Don't worry, Mayor—I'm on my way!"<br>
            When Roxy arrived, police officers had surrounded Metro City Bakery. Detective Smith was watching from behind a police car.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            罗西飘到史密斯侦探旁边：“嗨，侦探先生！听说你今天的胃口很大。”&nbsp;<br>
            “很有意思，火箭女孩儿。”&nbsp;史密斯侦探说，“吃了所有食物的人可不是我。”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦，那是谁？”&nbsp;罗西问，“你有那个小偷的资料吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Roxy floated next to him. "Hi, Detective—I heard you have a big appetite today."<br>
            "Very funny, Rocket Girl," Detective Smith said. "I didn't eat all the food."<br>
            "Well, who did?" Roxy asked. "Do you have any information about the thief?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            史密斯侦探看了一眼他的笔记本：“我采访了乐购超市的两个工作人员，他们说小偷是个巨大的……”&nbsp;<br>
            砰！面包店的门炸开了。灰尘落下来以后，一个巨大的身影走了出来，罗西大吃一惊：“一头巨大的猪！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Detective Smith glanced at his notebook. "I interviewed two workers at Shopwell Supermarket who said the thief is a large— . . . "<br>
            Crash! The front of the bakery exploded. As the dust settled, a large figure stepped out and Roxy gasped. "A large pig!"

            “我还是很饿。”&nbsp;大猪拍着肚子抱怨着。<br>
            “这是一头会说话的猪。”&nbsp;罗西小声对史密斯侦探说。<br>
            “它拿着一个耙子。”&nbsp;史密斯侦探说。<br>
            面包店的主人跑出来大喊：“你毁了我的面包店！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm still hungry," the pig complained, patting his belly.<br>
            "It's a talking pig," Roxy whispered to Detective Smith.<br>
            "He's holding a rake," Detective Smith said.<br>
            The bakery's owner raced outside, yelling, "You destroyed my bakery!"

            “哼！”&nbsp;大猪走开了。<br>

            大猪哼了一声：“不！”&nbsp;<br>
            咻！罗西的眼睛发出激光，打中了大猪的脸。<br>
            “哎呀！你是怎么做到的？”&nbsp;大猪揉着脸问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bah!" The pig walked away.<br>
            "Stop right there!" Roxy shouted.<br>
            The pig snorted. "No!"<br>
            Whiz-hoo! Roxy fired her eye laser beams, striking the pig in the face.<br>
            "Ouch! How did you do that?" he asked, rubbing his face.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我有超能力！”&nbsp;罗西飞起来撞向大猪，他们滚过人行道。人们都跳开了。<br>
            大猪跳起来，挥着耙子：“你是谁？”&nbsp;<br>
            “所有的坏人都知道我是谁。”&nbsp;罗西说着避开了耙子。<br>
            咻！她的眼睛又发出激光。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I have superpowers!" Roxy flew into him, and they tumbled across the sidewalk. People leaped out of the way.<br>
            The pig jumped to his feet and swung his rake. "Who are you?"<br>
            "Every villain knows who I am," Roxy said, dodging the rake. Whiz-hoo! She shot her eye laser beams again.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大猪用耙子挡住激光：“可我不是坏人，我是猪八戒。”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦，我是火箭女孩儿，一个强大的超级英雄！”&nbsp;罗西说着，冲向八戒。<br>
            八戒挺起胸膛：“我是一个厉害的神仙！”&nbsp;他举起耙子准备攻击，但是罗西重重地撞向他。砰！八戒向后飞去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The pig blocked the laser beams with his rake. "But I'm not a villain—I'm Zhu Bajie."<br>
            "Well, I'm Rocket Girl—a powerful superhero!" Roxy said, charging toward Bajie.<br>
            Bajie puffed out his chest. "I'm a powerful spirit!" He held up his rake, ready to strike, but Roxy slammed into him—pow! Bajie flew backward.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “小心！”&nbsp;一个骑自行车的女人急忙停下。<br>
            砰！八戒撞在消防栓上。水喷了出来，把出租车推向一个花架。<br>
            当罗西去帮助出租车司机时，八戒挠了挠头。<br>
            “我还是跑吧。”&nbsp;他想，“这个人跟神仙一样厉害。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Watch out!" A woman on a bike swerved.<br>
            Crack! Bajie hit a fire hydrant. Water sprayed, and a taxi slid into a flower stand.<br>
            As Roxy went to help the taxi driver, Bajie rubbed his head. <br>
            "I'd better escape," he thought. "This person is powerful, like a goddess."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            八戒念了句咒语。他跳上一朵云，突然一股香味飘了过来。<br>
            “什么吃的这么香？”&nbsp;他嘀咕着。八戒闻着香味，飞向远处的一座大楼。<br>
            “猪八戒去哪儿了？”&nbsp;罗西嘀咕着看向四周。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bajie recited a spell. As he leaped onto a cloud, a delicious aroma drifted through the air toward him.<br>
            "What wonderful food is that?" he murmured. Bajie followed the smell. It was coming from a building in the distance.<br>
            "Where did Zhu Bajie go?" Roxy murmured, looking around.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>

            “那头大猪驾着云跑了。”&nbsp;史密斯侦探匆匆跑过来说。<br>
            罗西睁大了眼睛：“他会飞？飞去哪边了？”&nbsp;<br>
            “那边。”&nbsp;史密斯侦探用手指着美罗城小学的方向说。<br>
            罗西飞得很快，她看到八戒落在了学校门口。罗西落在了八戒前面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The pig flew away on a cloud," Detective Smith said, hurrying over.<br>
            Roxy's eyes went wide. "He can fly? Which way did he go?"<br>
            "That way," Detective Smith said, pointing toward Metro City Elementary School.<br>
            Roxy flew fast and spotted Bajie landing near the school's entrance. She landed in front of Bajie.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            八戒来回挥动着耙子：“别烦我！”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西抓住了耙子。<br>
            “看！”&nbsp;玛拉说，“那是火箭女孩儿！她正在和一头猪打架！”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西的朋友们跑到窗边。<br>
            “放开我的耙子！”&nbsp;八戒大喊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bajie waved his rake back and forth. "Leave me alone!"<br>
            Roxy grabbed the rake.<br>
            "Look!" Mara said. "It's Rocket Girl—she's fighting a pig!"<br>
            Roxy's friends ran to the window.<br>
            "Let go of my rake!" Bajie shouted.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不！”&nbsp;罗西从他手中抢过耙子。<br>
            “加油，火箭女孩儿！”&nbsp;特勒尔挥着拳头大喊。<br>
            八戒跺着脚向罗西走去，但他突然停下来，然后弯下腰开始喘气。<br>
            罗西挠了挠头：“呃……你在做什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No!" Roxy yanked the rake from his hand.<br>
            "Go, Rocket Girl," Terrell cried, pumping his fist.<br>
            Bajie stomped toward Roxy, but abruptly he stopped to bend over and take a breath.<br>
            Roxy scratched her head. "Er . . . What are you doing?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “休息。”&nbsp;八戒回答。<br>
            罗西张大了嘴巴：“什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我说我累了！”&nbsp;八戒大喊，“而且我……嗝！我吃多了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你被逮捕了，猪八戒。”&nbsp;罗西说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Resting," Bajie answered.<br>
            Roxy's mouth dropped open. "What?"<br>
            "I'm tired!" Bajie yelled, "and I—burp!—I ate too much."<br>
            "You're under arrest, Bajie," Roxy said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            八戒突然从地上拔起一个标志牌扔向罗西。罗西低头躲开了，标志牌砸向一辆路过的卡车。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;卡车被撞进了灌木丛。<br>
            罗西去帮助司机。她回来的时候，八戒已经不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly Bajie pulled a sign out of the ground and flung it at Roxy. She ducked, and the sign hit a passing truck.<br>
            "Ahh!" The driver crashed into a bush.<br>
            Roxy hurried away to help the driver. When she returned, Bajie had disappeared.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            罗西用超级听力听到了八戒的声音。她顺着声音找到了学校的设备室。罗西打开门，她看到八戒正躺在健身垫上呼呼大睡。罗西慢慢地、悄悄地把八戒举起来，然后把他送进了监狱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Using her super hearing, Roxy heard Bajie. She followed the sound to the school's equipment shed. She threw the door open and saw Bajie inside, sleeping on a gym mat. Slowly and quietly, Roxy lifted Bajie up and carried him off to jail.

            孙悟空一行人在一片草地上醒来。蜜蜂嗡嗡飞舞，鸟儿在歌唱，树叶在微风中沙沙作响。<br>
            “多么美好的一天！”&nbsp;唐僧说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Sun Wukong and his companions woke up in a meadow. Bees buzzed and birds sang as leaves rustled in a gentle breeze.<br>
            "What a lovely day," the Tang Monk said.

            “到了西天您就知道了，师父。”&nbsp;悟空说，“那里每天的天气都很好。”&nbsp;<br>

            “我去牵马。”&nbsp;悟净说。<br>
            八戒还在睡着，大张着嘴，流着口水。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Just wait until you see the Western Paradise, Master," Wukong said. "The weather is always beautiful there."<br>
            "I can't wait, so let's start walking," the monk said.<br>
            "I'll prepare the horse," Wujing said.<br>
            Bajie lay asleep, drooling with his mouth open.

            悟空踢了踢八戒：“起来！”&nbsp;<br>

            “快起来，懒猪！”&nbsp;悟空用力踢了八戒一脚。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;八戒跳起来大喊，“为什么踢我？”&nbsp;<br>
            “谁让你不起来！”&nbsp;悟空说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong shook Bajie. "Wake up!"<br>
            Bajie rolled over.<br>
            "Get up, lazy!" Wukong kicked Bajie.<br>
            "Ouch!" Bajie cried, jumping up. "Why did you kick me?"<br>
            "You didn't get up," Wukong said.

            “你不能有点儿礼貌吗？”&nbsp;八戒说。<br>
            “我很有礼貌。”&nbsp;悟空说。<br>
            “不，你没有！”&nbsp;八戒正说着，肚子咕咕叫了起来，“我要做些早饭吃。”&nbsp;<br>
            “八戒，我们一会儿再吃。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“现在要走了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can’t you be more polite?" Bajie said.<br>
            "I am polite." Wukong said.<br>
            "No, you are not!" Bajie said. Just then his stomach growled. "I'll cook some food for breakfast."<br>
            "We'll eat later, Bajie," the Tang Monk said. "Now we need to start walking."

            “哎！”&nbsp;八戒抱怨着，“我们总是在走路！”&nbsp;<br>
            很快，他们来到一个小山村。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ugh," Bajie complained. "All we ever do is walk!"<br>
            They soon arrived in a mountain village.<br>
            "Be careful—demons could be nearby," Wukong warned the others. "They might want to eat the Master."

            村民们微笑着向他们挥手，悟空拿出了他的金箍棒。<br>
            唐僧瞪了他一眼：“悟空，把金箍棒收起来。”&nbsp;<br>
            “师父说得对，这里看起来很安全。”&nbsp;悟净说。<br>
            悟空叹了一口气，收起金箍棒。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As villagers smiled and waved, Wukong pulled out his iron bar.<br>
            The Tang Monk glared at him. "Put that away, Wukong."<br>
            "Master is right—this place seems safe," Sha Wujing said.<br>
            Wukong sighed and put the bar away.

            “远方来的客人们，你们好！”&nbsp;一个村民说，“进来吃点儿早饭吧。”&nbsp;<br>

            唐僧行了个礼：“非常感谢，但是我们赶时间。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒皱了皱眉，但悟空放心了。“师父要继续赶路太好了。”&nbsp;悟空想，“这个地方感觉很危险。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Greetings, travelers," a villager said. "Please come inside and have some breakfast."<br>
            "That sounds wonderful!" Bajie said with a grin.<br>
            The Tang Monk bowed. "Thank you very much, but we're in a hurry."<br>
            Bajie frowned, but Wukong felt relieved. "I'm glad Master wants to keep walking," he thought. "This place seems dangerous."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一片乌云遮住了天空。<br>
            “看来要下雨了。”&nbsp;唐僧抬起头说，“也许我们应该在这里吃个早饭。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那可能是妖怪。”&nbsp;悟空望着那片不祥的乌云，心想。<br>
            他转过身说：“我去看看！在我回来之前，你们哪个房子都不要进！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A dark cloud formed in the sky.<br>
            "It looks like it will rain," the Tang Monk said, looking up. "Maybe we should stop here for breakfast."<br>
            "That might be a demon," Wukong thought, gazing at the ominous cloud. He turned to his companions. "I’ll go take a look. Don't enter any of these houses until I return."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “悟空有时候太小心了。”&nbsp;悟空一走，八戒就哼哼着说。<br>
            就在这时，唐僧感到有一滴雨落在他的头上。<br>
            更多的雨滴落下。突然就下起了暴雨，把唐僧、八戒和悟净都淋湿了。<br>
            一个村民打开了门：“快进来避避雨吧，里面暖和。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wukong is too careful sometimes," Bajie said with a snort as Wukong flew off.<br>
            Just then the Tang Monk felt a raindrop on top of his head. More drops fell, and suddenly rain poured down, soaking the Tang Monk, Bajie, and Wujing.<br>
            A villager opened his door. "Come on in and take shelter from rain, it’s warm inside."
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “走吧，我们先进去避避雨吧。”&nbsp;唐僧说。<br>
            唐僧一行人急忙进了村民的房子。<br>
            空中，悟空靠近了乌云。他躲在一小朵云后面，偷偷看向乌云里。<br>
            一个大妖怪坐在上面，一群小妖怪正在向他磕头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let’s go. Let's get out of this rain first," the Tang Monk said. He and his companions hurried into the villager's house.<br>
            Up in the sky, Wukong approached the dark cloud. Hiding behind a smaller cloud, he peeked out at the dark one. A huge demon sat on it as several small demons bowed to him.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我就知道有妖怪！”&nbsp;悟空心想。<br>

            “我们大王能造雨！”&nbsp;另一个小妖说。<br>
            “是的！”&nbsp;黑雨大王笑着说，“很快我们就能吃了唐僧，长生不老了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I knew there was a demon!" Wukong thought.<br>
            "Our master, the Demon of Black Rain, is amazing," one small demon said.<br>
            "Our master can make rain!" another one said.<br>
            "Yes, I can," the huge demon said with a laugh. "Soon we'll eat the Tang Monk and live forever!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妖怪们笑着欢呼起来。<br>
            “妖怪们就是蠢，雨怎么伤害师父呢。”&nbsp;悟空摇着头低声说。<br>
            悟空重新回到地面，他大吃一惊：“村子不见了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The demons laughed and cheered.<br>
            "Those demons are dumb—rain won't hurt Master," Wukong murmured, shaking his head.<br>
            Wukong went back down to the ground. He gasped. "The village is gone!"

            唐僧小声地哭着：“悟空是对的，那些善良的村民原来都是妖怪！”&nbsp;<br>
            他被绳子绑在一根柱子上。八戒和悟净也被绑了起来。<br>
            “我们应该听悟空的话。”&nbsp;悟净一边说一边努力挣脱绳子。

            The Tang Monk was crying quietly. "Wukong was right. Those nice villagers turned out to be demons!"<br>
            He was tied to a column by ropes. Bajie and Wujing were tied up too.<br>
            "We should have listened to Wukong," Wujing said, struggling to break free.

            “那是真的。”&nbsp;迅翼叹了一口气，“咒语打开了通向另一个世界的传送门，只要穿过那道门，就会到达那个世界。”&nbsp;

            "Amazing," the Demon of Black Rain whispered. "The image looks so real."<br>

            Crash! A door exploded, and Bajie ran into the throne room.<br>

            "It happens all the time." Bajie shrugged. "It's usually not a big deal. I defeated them. I'm powerful so they were definitely afraid of me. But this time somebody tripped me. Then all of a sudden, I was here in this kingdom!"

            悟空能理解师父被骗，但他不能理解八戒和悟净也被骗。

            Wukong looked around the mountain where he'd left his companions.<br>
            "That village was an illusion," he thought. "When the Demon of Black Rain made the rainstorm, Master probably entered a house."<br>
            Wukong understood why the Tang Monk had fallen for the trick. But Wujing and Bajie should have known better.

            悟空叹了一口气：“这附近肯定有山洞，妖怪一般都住在山洞里。”&nbsp;<br>
            他找遍了整座山，终于发现了一扇门。<br>
            悟空砰砰砸着门大喊：“妖怪，快放了我师父！不然…….”&nbsp;他挥着拳头，喊着各种可怕的话。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong sighed. "There must be a cave nearby since demons usually live in caves."<br>
            Wukong searched all over the mountain's slopes. Finally he found a door. He pounded on the door and shouted, "Demons! Release my master right now or else!" Wukong shook his fist and yelled all sorts of terrible things.

            Wukong found the Tang Monk and Wujing, and untied them.<br>

            “他不在山洞里。”&nbsp;悟空说。

            "You're welcome, Master." Wukong looked around. "Where's Bajie?"<br>
            Wujing seemed surprised. "You didn't see him? He broke free and went to fight the demons."<br>
            "He's not in the cave," Wukong said.

            悟空也摇了摇头：“八戒有时候真是该打！”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk shook his head. "He kept complaining about being hungry, so he probably went to find food."<br>
            Wujing frowned. "How could Bajie leave without us! How terrible!"<br>
            Wukong shook his head. "Sometimes Bajie needs to get punishmed!"

            就在这时，悟空听到了脚步声，他看到了一个正要逃跑的迅翼。悟空迅速跳到迅翼的面前。<br>

            Just then Wukong heard footsteps and realized  Swift Wing was trying to sneak by. Wukong quickly jumped in front of Swift Wing.<br>

            "Grr!" Roxy punched and kicked, sending the tiny Wukongs flying in all directions. But more kept attacking her. Whiz-hoo! Her eye laser beams zapped several tiny Wukongs. Whoo-oo-oosh! Her super breath blew more away, but tiny Wukongs kept coming!

            "Where am I?" Roxy muttered as she stood in the middle of a road. "How did I get here?" She looked around. "And where's Sun Wukong? He was right in front of me a second ago!"<br>
            As Roxy explored her new surroundings, she realized she was still up in the mountains. But below there was nothing but dark wilderness. She couldn’t see Metro city either.

            一个男人走向前，手里拿着大大的木棒。“把钱交出来！”&nbsp;他大喊。

            Roxy heard voices approaching too. Suddenly several tough-looking men walked toward her.<br>
            "Hi!" Roxy called, waving to the men. "Can you please tell me where I am?"<br>
            One man stepped forward, gripping a heavy wooden club. "Give us all your money," he yelled.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Roxy rolled her eyes and shot back, "You don't scare me!"<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ahh!" <br>

            “肯定是她！”&nbsp;矮妖怪回答。<br>
            罗西沿着路往前走。“这下麻烦了。”&nbsp;她心想，“天这么黑，我都不知道我在哪儿，要怎么回家。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Did you see that?" the short demon whispered to the tall one.<br>

            "She must be," the short demon replied.<br>
            Roxy walked along the road. "This is bad," she thought. "It's dark and I have no idea where I am. I need to get home."

            就在这时，两位老人走了过来。“孩子，你迷路了吗？”&nbsp;老爷爷问。<br>
            罗西看了他们一会儿，觉得他们看起来很友好，可以相信。<br>
            于是她说了真话：“是的，我迷路了。”&nbsp;

            Just then an old man and woman came along. "Hello, child, are you lost?" the old man asked.<br>

            "Yes, I'm lost," Roxy admitted.

            “你看起来很累。”&nbsp;老奶奶说，“我们在一个地主家工作，地主很善良，你要不要跟我们一起回去？他会让你住一晚的。”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西跟着两位老人，来到山上的一座漂亮的大房子。<br>
            老爷爷给她拿来热腾腾的食物，老奶奶带她去了舒适的房间。罗西很快就睡着了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You look tired," the old woman said. "We work for a wealthy squire who's quite kind. Why don't you come with us? The squire will let you stay at his house tonight."<br>
            Roxy followed the couple to a big, beautiful house on the mountain. The old man brought Roxy a plate of warm food. Then the old woman showed her to a cozy bedroom, where Roxy quickly fell asleep.

            The next morning Roxy had tea with the squire.<br>

            The squire leaned closer. "Do you come from . . . another world?"<br>

            “哦，好吧。”&nbsp;悟空点了点头，“这个我相信，现在你可以放了他，我们要回到师父身边。”&nbsp;

            三个朋友在杰克家，他们用手机玩儿游戏。<br>
            “希望罗西没事儿。”&nbsp;杰克说。<br>
            特勒尔没说话。他知道罗西那天晚上去做火箭女孩儿了，但从那以后，他们就没有罗西的消息了。

            "Where did Roxy go?" Mara said to Jack and Terrell.<br>

            "I hope Roxy is okay," Jack said.<br>
            Terrell didn't say anything. He knew Roxy had left yesterday evening to do Rocket Girl stuff. But none of them had heard from her since then.

            就在这时，玛拉的手机响了。“快看这条大新闻！”&nbsp;玛拉说，“昨天和火箭女孩儿打斗的那头大猪从监狱里逃跑了。一只会说话的猴子帮了他！”&nbsp;<br>
            “真的吗？”&nbsp;特勒尔弯下身子。<br>
            “看，这里还有视频！”&nbsp;杰克说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then Mara's phone beeped. "Check out this incredible news alert," she said. "The pig that Rocket Girl was fighting yesterday just broke out of jail. A talking monkey helped him!"<br>
            "Really?" Terrell leaned over.<br>
            "Look, there's a video," Jack said.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            玛拉点开了视频，他们看到美罗城监狱的一面墙炸开了。大猪从里面跳出来，后面跟着一只猴子。猴子挥着铁棒，打中了一辆警车，然后他们跳上一朵云，飞走了。<br>
            杰克张大了嘴巴：“那只猴子太酷了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mara clicked on the video, and they watched one side of Metro City Jail explode. Then the pig leaped out, followed by a monkey. The monkey twirled a bar and hit a police car. Then they leaped onto a cloud and flew away.<br>
            Jack's mouth hung open. "That monkey is so cool!"

            罗西很惊讶：“你为什么会觉得我是女神仙？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Roxy stared at the ugly demon. "Who are you?"<br>

            Roxy was confused. "Why do you think I'm a goddess?"

            "Who's the Tang Monk?" Roxy asked. "And what do you mean by 'share'?"<br>
            "He's an important monk," the demon said, a grin spreading across his face. "Anyone who eats him will live forever!"

            “你真邪恶！”&nbsp;罗西说，“我现在就去放了他！”&nbsp;罗西向门口跑去。<br>
            “你敢！”&nbsp;黑雨大王大喊，他跳到罗西的面前挡住了她。<br>
            罗西握紧了拳头。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You're evil," Roxy said, "and I'm going to free those prisoners right now!" She rushed toward a door.<br>
            "Don't you dare!" the demon roared, leaping in front of Roxy to block her path.<br>
            Roxy made a fist.

            呼！强风暴雨吹进山洞，把罗西吹倒了。“啊！”&nbsp;罗西在空中翻滚，四处碰撞。风把她吹出山洞，吹向了天边的太阳。最后，她掉在了一个灌木丛中。<br>
            砰！山洞的门关上了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Whoosh! Strong wind and rain swept through the cave, knocking Roxy off her feet. "Ahh!" Roxy tumbled through the air and slammed into walls. The wind carried her out of the cave and into the sunlight. Finally she crashed into a shrub.<br>
            Bang! The cave's door slammed shut.

            "Ouch!" The demon threw a punch.

            "The Tang Monk is traveling to the West," the spirit said. "He hopes to receive the True Scriptures from Buddha. The scriptures will help the people in the Tang Empire to be good. Everyone wants him to succeed."

            “他们带走了我的朋友们！”&nbsp;罗西喊。<br>

            他们也一起进了传送门。

            "Don't let them get away!" Wujing shouted.<br>
            They ran through the portal too.

            "I know where we are—Birdsong Mountain!" Roxy said. As the demon hurried up to the mountain, Roxy and Wukong chased him.<br>

            "Bajie, Wujing!" Wukong said. "You two save them! We will deal with the Demon of Black Rain!"<br>
            Wukong and Roxy searched all over the mountain.<br>
            Roxy frowned. "Where on earth is he?"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “小心！”&nbsp;一块巨石向他们滚来。他们跳起来避开了。黑雨大王笑了起来，然后暴风雨又来了。<br>
            罗西咬着牙：“我受不了这个妖怪的暴风雨了！”&nbsp;她开始旋转，速度越来越快——罗西变成了龙卷风。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Look out!" Wukong shouted as a huge boulder rolled down toward them. They jumped out of the way. The Demon of Black Rain laughed, and then wind and rain poured down.<br>
            Roxy gritted her teeth. "I am tired of this dumb demon's wind and rain!" She started to spin, quickly picking up speed as she whirled faster and faster. Roxy became a tornado.

            悟空惊讶地张大了嘴巴：“哇！”&nbsp;<br>
            罗西旋转上山，把石头和泥土吹得到处都是。暴风雨被吹了回去，打在黑雨大王的脸上。<br>
            “啊！”&nbsp;黑雨大王向后摔倒，瓶子掉在了地上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong's mouth dropped open out of surprise. "Wow!"<br>
            Roxy zoomed up the mountain, blowing rocks and dirt all over. The wind and rain blew back toward the demon, whipping across his face.<br>
            "Ahh!" The demon fell backward and dropped the jar.

            “太好了！”&nbsp;悟空跳到空中，挥起金箍棒。砰！光芒四射，黑雨大王消失了。一只蝾螈趴在他站的地方。<br>
            “哎呀！”&nbsp;罗西笑着说，“好可爱！”&nbsp;<br>
            “一点儿都不可爱。”&nbsp;悟空说着举起金箍棒，“这是妖怪，必须消灭掉。”&nbsp;<br>
            就在这时，一个声音响起：“不要伤害那只蝾螈！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes!" Wukong leaped through the air and swung his iron bar. Bam! Light sparkled briefly, and the demon was gone. A small salamander lay where he had been.<br>
            "Aww!" Roxy said, smiling. "Cute!"<br>
            "It's not cute at all." Wukong raised the iron bar. "It's an evil spirit, and it must be destroyed."<br>
            Just then a voice boomed, "Do not harm that salamander!"

            A fire warrior flew down from the sky. He grabbed the salamander and picked up the jar.<br>

            Bajie let out a huge burp, and Mara snorted.<br>
            "I often make trouble too," Jack said to Wukong. "I can never sit still at school."<br>
            Wukong grinned. "I was criticized many times because I couldn’t sit still. You should try meditating—it helps me to stay calm."

            Wukong showed Jack how to close his eyes and breathe slowly. Suddenly Jack felt himself floating, and his eyes flew open.<br>

            "It's magic!" Wukong laughed and lowered Jack back down.

            “要是我能帮你就好了。”&nbsp;特勒尔说。<br>

            "Roxy," Terrell asked quietly, "is this the world where you were when you were missing?"<br>
            Roxy nodded. "I was stuck here fighting that demon for a while."<br>
            "I wish I could have helped you," Terrell said.<br>
            "I don't think you could have helped, Terrell. The demon was really powerful."

            “我试试。”&nbsp;罗西说着，离开桌子，跟悟净去了别的地方。<br>
            特勒尔深深地叹了一口气。唐僧在他的旁边坐下：“怎么了？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Excuse me, Rocket Girl," Wujing interrupted. "Can you teach me how to shoot fire from my eyes before you leave?"<br>
            "I can try." Roxy and Wujing wandered away from the table. <br>
            Terrell let out a deep sigh. The Tang Monk sat down beside him. "What's wrong?"

            “我也没有超能力。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“但是这不代表我不能帮助我的徒弟们。悟空、八戒和悟净很久以前犯下了可怕的罪行。现在我正在帮助他们向善，让他们得到原谅。我相信你也一定会找到帮助朋友的方法。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I want to help Rocket Girl, but I don't have any superpowers," Terrell said.<br>
            "I don't have superpowers either," the Tang Monk said. "But that doesn't mean I can't help my apprentices. Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing committed terrible crimes long ago. Now I'm helping them to be good and earn forgiveness. I'm sure you'll eventually find a way to help your friend."

            “我也希望。”&nbsp;特勒尔点了点头，但其实他依然没有信心，他已经试过很多次去帮助罗西了。<br>
            终于，唐僧师徒们要继续去西天取经了。悟空打开了传送门。<br>
            “再见！”&nbsp;大家同时说。<br>
            罗西对悟空笑了笑：“要努力向善哦！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I hope so." Terrell nodded, but he still felt uncertain. He'd tried to help Roxy many times before.<br>
            At last it was time for the Tang Monk and his apprentices to continue their journey. Wukong opened the portal.<br>
            "Good-bye!" everyone said.<br>
            Roxy smiled at Wukong. "Be good!"

            罗西咽了咽口水。“哎呀！”&nbsp;她心想，“要怎么说？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是我告诉罗西的。”&nbsp;特勒尔马上说，“嗯，我刚才给罗西打电话了。她去了叔叔家，刚回来，所以我就让她来这里找我们了。”&nbsp;

            "Hey, guys!" Roxy found her friends in Metro City Park.<br>
            Jack raised an eyebrow. "How did you know we were here?"<br>
            Roxy gulped. "Oh no," she thought. "What should I say?"<br>
            "I told her," Terrell blurted out. "Yeah, I talked to Roxy earlier, and she said she was away, visiting her uncle. She just got back, so I told her to come and meet us here."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Roxy nodded. "Yep, that's right!" She shot Terrell a look that silently said, "thank you." <br>
            A big smile formed across Terrell's face.<br>
            "Roxy," Mara said. "We have a fantastic story to tell you."<br>
            Jack nodded excitedly. "You'll regret missing out!"
