        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有一天晚上，森林里特别温暖。月光明亮，照进狼洞口。狼爸爸休息一整天后醒过来，打了个哈欠。狼妈妈躺在近处。她把鼻子放在滚来滚去叫个不停的四只狼宝宝身边。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was a very warm evening in the jungle. The moon shone brightly into the mouth of the wolves' cave. Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest and yawned. Mother Wolf lay nearby. She kept her nose on their four tumbling, squealing cubs.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼爸爸伸了个懒腰。“狼妈妈，又该去打猎了。”&nbsp;<br>
            这时，洞口出现一个影子，长着一条毛茸茸的尾巴。狼爸爸皱起了眉头。那是豺狼塔巴其。塔巴其总是要吃的，所以狼爸爸和狼妈妈很讨厌他。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Father Wolf stretched. "It's time to hunt again, Mother."<br>
            Just then a shadow with a bushy tail appeared at the entrance of the cave. Father Wolf frowned. It was Tabaqui, the jackal. The wolves disliked Tabaqui because he was always looking for food.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们也很怕塔巴其，因为塔巴其又狡猾，又脾气坏。有时候，他会疯狂地在森林里跑，看见什么就咬什么。当塔巴其发疯的时候，甚至连凶恶的老虎谢尔坎也离他远远的。<br>
            “我肚子饿。”&nbsp;塔巴其说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They were afraid of him too, because he was cunning and had a bad temper. Sometimes he ran madly through the forest, biting everything he saw. When Tabaqui acted like that, even the fierce tiger, Shere Khan, stayed away from him.<br>
            "I'm hungry," Tabaqui said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你进来看看吧，塔巴其。”&nbsp;狼爸爸叹了口气说，“可是，我可以向你保证，这里没有食物。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我也许能找点吃的。”&nbsp;塔巴其回答。他慢慢地朝洞里面走去，用鼻子到处闻。很快，他就发现了一根放了很久的骨头，上面有一点肉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Come inside and look around, Tabaqui," Father Wolf said with a sigh. "But I promise you. There is no food here."<br>
            "I might find something," Tabaqui replied. He slunk toward the cave and sniffed around. Soon he found an old bone with a scrap of meat.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢你的食物，很好吃。”&nbsp;塔巴其说，舔了舔嘴唇。他盯着小小的狼宝宝。“哎哟，你的孩子们真好看。”&nbsp;<br>
            狼妈妈走近孩子们。她和狼爸爸对视了一眼，显得很不安。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thanks for the meal. I ate well." he said, licking his lips. He stared at the tiny wolf cubs. "I must say, your children are beautiful."<br>
            Mother Wolf moved closer to her cubs. She and Father exchanged nervous glances.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊，还有......”&nbsp;塔巴其继续说，“谢尔坎发现了几个新的打猎地点。他告诉我他会暂时在这里打猎。”&nbsp;<br>
            “在这里？”&nbsp;狼妈妈惊讶地说。<br>
            “可是，他没有权利在这里打猎！”&nbsp;狼爸爸大喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, by the way," Tabaqui went on, "Shere Khan has found some new hunting grounds. He told me he will be hunting here for a while."<br>
            "Here?" Mother Wolf said in surprise.<br>
            "But he has no right to hunt here!" Father Wolf exclaimed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢尔坎必须呆在河边，那是森林法则！”&nbsp;<br>
            塔巴其笑了。“要不要我告诉他你在担心什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “出去！”&nbsp;狼爸爸厉声说，“去跟你的主人打猎吧，塔巴其，你折磨了我们一个晚上，够了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Shere Khan must stay near the river. That’s the law of the jungle!"<br>
            Tabaqui laughed. "Shall I tell him about your concern?"<br>
            "Out!" Father Wolf snapped at the jackal. "Go hunt with your master, Tabaqui. You've bothered us enough for one night."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我会走的。”&nbsp;塔巴其平静地说，“不过，别忘了谢尔坎的新打猎地点，我警告过你。其实，你现在就能听见他的声音。他在下面的灌木里打猎呢。”&nbsp;<br>
            塔巴其走后，狼爸爸走出了洞。他真的听见下面山谷里传来老虎的低吼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I will go," Tabaqui said quietly. "But remember my warning about Shere Khan's new hunting place. You can hear him right now, in fact. He's below, hunting among the bushes."<br>
            After Tabaqui was gone, Father Wolf stepped out of the cave. Below in the valley, he could indeed hear the low snarls of a tiger.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈走出来，站在他旁边。“看来谢尔坎今晚不会吃动物，我觉得他会吃人。”&nbsp;<br>
            狼爸爸龇了龇白白的牙齿。“森林里瓢虫和青蛙那么多。老虎为什么非得吃人呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother Wolf came out and stood beside him. "It sounds like Shere Khan is not hunting animals tonight. I think he is hunting humans."<br>
            Father Wolf flashed his white teeth. "There are plenty of beetles and frogs in the jungle. Why must that tiger hunt humans?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈叹了口气。森林里有一条重要法则——动物不可以吃人。<br>
            老虎的吼声越来越大，突然，传来了哭声。狼爸爸和狼妈妈听得见谢尔坎在灌木丛里痛苦地滚来滚去。他疼哭了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother Wolf sighed. An important law ruled the jungle. Animals were not supposed to hunt humans.<br>
            The tiger's snarls grew louder, and then there was a howl. The wolves could hear Shere Khan tumbling about in the bushes. He was howling in pain.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那只傻老虎可能跑进了人类的篝火，听上去他的脚好像被火烫了。”&nbsp;狼爸爸说。<br>
            狼妈妈动了动一只耳朵，仔细地听着。“好像有什么东西往山顶跑呢！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That foolish tiger probably jumped at a human's campfire. It sounds like he burned his feet," Father Wolf said.<br>
            Mother Wolf twitched one ear, listening carefully. "Something is coming uphill!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            附近的灌木沙沙响了起来。狼爸爸放低身子准备出击。可是，突然，狼妈妈惊讶地倒吸了一口气。<br>
            “是个人类宝宝！”&nbsp;<br>
            一个小男孩儿站在狼爸爸和狼妈妈面前。这个小人类看着狼爸爸的脸，眨了眨眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The nearby bushes rustled. Father Wolf dropped low, ready to pounce. But then Mother Wolf let out a gasp.<br>
            "It's a man cub!"<br>
            A very young boy stood in front of the wolves. The tiny human blinked as he stared into Father Wolf's face.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “狼爸爸！”&nbsp;狼妈妈小声说，“快！把这小男孩儿弄到我们洞里去！”&nbsp;<br>
            狼爸爸走上前，轻轻地叼住了小男孩儿的脖子。然后，把小男孩儿叼进洞里放在了狼宝宝们旁边。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Father!" Mother Wolf whispered. "Quick! Bring that man cub into our cave!"<br>
            Father Wolf stepped forward and closed his jaws very gently on the child's neck. Then he carried the boy into the cave, dropping him near his own small cubs.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈非常惊讶，目不转睛地盯着那个小人类。“真小！”&nbsp;狼妈妈温柔地说。那个小男孩儿挤进两只狼宝宝中间取暖。“你看！他不怕我们，也不怕宝宝们。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我听说过有人类小孩儿和狼群一起生活。”&nbsp;狼爸爸说，“可是，在我们狼群里，我从来没见过。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother Wolf gazed at the small human in wonder. "So small!" she said softly. The young boy was squirming between two cubs to get warm. "Look at that! He's not afraid of us or the cubs."<br>
            "I've heard of young humans living with wolves," Father Wolf said. "But I've never seen it in my own pack."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这时，狼爸爸和狼妈妈听到什么声音，朝洞口转过身去。原来是塔巴其和老虎谢尔坎来了。<br>
            “那个小孩儿在这儿，主人！”&nbsp;豺狼兴奋地喊着，“我看见他了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then the wolves heard something and spun toward the entrance of the cave. Tabaqui had returned—with the tiger, Shere Khan.<br>
            "The child is here, master!" the jackal said eagerly. "I see him."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢尔坎，您的来访让我们非常荣幸。”&nbsp;狼爸爸很有礼貌地说。但他的双眼却闪烁着愤怒。“您需要什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “一个人类孩子朝这边儿走了。”&nbsp;谢尔坎说，“他的父母逃跑了。把人类的孩子交给我。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Shere Khan, your visit brings us great honor," Father Wolf said politely. But his eyes sparked with anger. "What do you need?"<br>
            "A human cub went this way," Shere Khan said. "His parents have run off. Give the man cub to me."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            幸好洞口很窄，谢尔坎进不来。<br>
            “我们狼是自由的动物。”&nbsp;狼爸爸说，“我们听头狼的话，不听你的。”&nbsp;<br>
            老虎的怒吼在洞里回荡。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Luckily, the cave entrance was too narrow for Shere Khan to enter.<br>
            "We wolves are free creatures," said Father Wolf. "We take orders from the head of the pack, not from you."<br>
            The tiger's furious roar filled the cave.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈跳到了谢尔坎面前。在黑暗中，她的眼睛像两个绿色的月亮。<br>
            “那个人类孩子是我的！”&nbsp;狼妈妈咆哮着，“孩子不会被杀死的。孩子会和狼群一起奔跑，和狼群一起打猎。现在，请你离开，谢尔坎！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother Wolf sprang forward. In the darkness her eyes were like two green moons.<br>
            "The human cub is mine!" She growled. "He will not be killed. He will live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack. Now go, Shere Khan!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼爸爸惊讶地看着这一幕。狼爸爸忘了他的妻子生气时会有多可怕。<br>
            谢尔坎退到洞口外面。“我等着看狼群会怎么处理人类的孩子！”&nbsp;他龇牙低吼，“那个孩子是我的，他会死在我的牙下！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Father looked on in amazement. He had forgotten how fierce his mate could be when she was angry.<br>
            Shere Khan backed away from the cave. "We'll see how the pack handles that human child!" He snarled. "He's mine, and he'll die by my teeth."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈跳到宝宝们中间。狼爸爸看着老虎大步离开。<br>
            “谢尔坎说了一个事实。“狼爸爸说着叹了一口气，“我们必须给狼群看这个人类孩子。你真的打算收留他吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother Wolf jumped down among her cubs. Father Wolf watched the tiger walk off.<br>
            "Shere Khan spoke the truth about one thing," Father said with a sigh. "We must show this cub to the pack. Do you really plan to keep him?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我当然要收留他！”&nbsp;狼妈妈厉声说，“这个可怜的小家伙晚上自己饿着肚子来到这里。我要给他起名叫毛克利。”&nbsp;她接着说，“总有一天，他会抓到谢尔坎，就像那只老虎抓他一样。”&nbsp;<br>
            狼爸爸很担心。“我们狼群会说什么呢？”&nbsp;森林法则很清楚。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Of course I'll keep him!" Mother snapped. "The poor little creature came at night, alone and hungry. I'll call him Mowgli," she added. "One day he will hunt Shere Khan, just as that tiger has hunted him."<br>
            Father was worried. "What will our pack say?" The law of the jungle was very clear.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼群保护小狼直到他们足够强大去自己打猎。但是，狼群好像不会保护一个人类宝宝。<br>
            “我们以后再说这件事吧。”&nbsp;狼妈妈坚定地回答。<br>
            每个月月圆的时候，狼群就开一次会。所有的新父母都要给大家看他们的孩子们。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The pack protected young cubs until they were old enough to hunt on their own. But the pack wasn't likely to protect a human cub.<br>
            "We'll talk about that later." Mother replied firmly.<br>
            Once every month when the moon was full, the wolf pack gathered. All new parents had to show their cubs to the pack.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在下一次狼群会议的那天晚上，狼爸爸和狼妈妈去参加岩石会议。狼宝宝们和毛克利跟在他们后面跑。岩石会议在山顶上开，那里有很多石头和巨石。<br>
            阿克拉是最厉害的大灰狼，他趴在一块岩石上。现在，他领导这个狼群已经一年了。他是一只智慧、健壮的头狼，了解人类的方式和习俗。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On the night of the next pack meeting, Father and Mother went to Council Rock. The wolf cubs and Mowgli ran after them. Council Rock was at the top of a mountain, a place covered with stones and rocks.<br>
            Akela, the great gray wolf, lay across a rock. He had led the pack for a year now. He was a wise, strong leader, who knew the ways and customs of people.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            岩石会议非常安静。所有的父母都围成了一个圆圈。在圆圈中央，狼宝宝们一起打滚、玩耍。<br>
            狼父母们一个接一个地给大家看自己的孩子。<br>
            “哦，大家快看！”&nbsp;阿克拉喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was very quiet at Council Rock. All the parents sat in a circle. In the center of the circle, the cubs tumbled over one another, playing.<br>
            One by one, the wolf parents showed their cubs to show the pack.<br>
            "Look well, oh, wolves!" Akela cried.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狼妈妈们激动地重复道：“哦，大家快看！”&nbsp;<br>
            狼妈妈的毛抖了一下。差不多到时候该给大家看毛克利了。狼群看到这个长相奇怪的人类宝宝会说什么呢？
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The mothers anxiously repeated the call. "Oh, Everybody look well !"<br>
            Mother's fur quivered. It was almost time to show Mowgli to the pack. What would the wolves say when they saw the odd-looking man cub?

            小男孩儿和狼宝宝们坐在圆圈里。他玩儿着一些在月光下闪闪发光的白卵石。狼爸爸用鼻子轻轻地朝前推了推毛克利。<br>
            “哦，大家快看！”&nbsp;阿克拉像对别的狼宝宝喊过那样喊道。还没等狼们来得及回答，岩石后面就传来了低吼声，是谢尔坎。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The small man cub sat in the circle with the wolf cubs. He was playing with some white pebbles that glowed in the moonlight. Father Wolf nudged Mowgli forward with his nose.<br>
            "Look well, oh, wolves!" Akela cried, as he'd done with the other cubs. Before any wolves could respond, a muffled roar came from behind the rocks. It was Shere Khan.

            森林法则是要有两只狼为狼宝宝说话。这是狼群接受狼宝宝的方式。

            "The cub is mine!" the tiger growled. "Give him to me!"<br>
            "Look well, oh, wolves!" Akela called. "Look well upon this cub!"<br>
            The law of the jungle was that two wolves had to speak for the cub. This was how the pack accepted the wolf cubs.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Who will speak for this cub?" Akela called.<br>
            Mother Wolf tensed, ready to defend Mowgli.<br>
            Akela was still waiting for someone to speak. Besides the wolves in the pack, only one other animal was allowed at Council Rock.

            那就是巴鲁，一头懒洋洋的棕熊，他教狼宝宝们森林法则。巴鲁只吃坚果、树根和蜂蜜。所以，森林里的动物们都不怕他。<br>

        </div>

            It was Baloo, a sleepy brown bear who taught the wolf cubs the law of the jungle. Baloo ate only nuts, roots, and honey, so none of the other jungle creatures feared him.<br>
            As Shere Khan stepped closer, Baloo got up with his front legs. He roared loudly. "I speak for the human cub. Let him run with the pack. I will teach him, as I teach the other cubs."

            “还有谁想为这个人类宝宝说话？”&nbsp;阿克拉问。<br>

            “阿克拉，我没资格呆在这里。”&nbsp;黑豹的嗓音像树上掉下的蜂蜜那样温柔。

            "Who else will speak for the human cub?" Akela asked.<br>
            Just then a black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera, the black panther. The wolves quickly backed away from him.<br>
            "Akela, I have no right to be here. " The black panther's voice was as soft as honey dripping from a tree.

            “阿克拉！”&nbsp;一只狼大喊道，“听巴希拉的吧。这个宝宝可以收钱卖掉。这是森林法则。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But the law of the jungle says a cub's life may be bought. Am I right?"<br>
            "Yes!" a few young wolves replied eagerly. The young wolves were always hungry.<br>
            "Akela!" one wolf called. "Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the law of the jungle."

            黑豹温柔地笑了。“我想提议一个买卖。巴鲁已经替这个小男孩儿说话了。如果你们其他人接受他，我就分给你们一些好吃的，是一头肥牛，刚杀的。”&nbsp;<br>
            狼妈妈看着狼爸爸。“那只黑豹为什么替毛克利说话？”&nbsp;她问。狼爸爸耸了耸肩。

            The black panther smiled gently. "I'd like to propose a deal. Baloo has already spoken for the boy. If the rest of you accept him, I will share some delicious food with you. It's a fat bull, freshly killed."<br>
            Mother Wolf looked at Father. "Why is the panther speaking up for Mowgli?" she said. Father shrugged.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The other wolves had gathered to discuss the situation.<br>
            "The boy will die in the winter rains," one said.<br>
            "He will burn in the sun," another added.<br>

            "Let's accept him. Let's let him run with the pack."<br>

            很快，狼群就开始下山去吃黑豹许诺的美餐。阿克拉、巴希拉、巴鲁和毛克利一家子留在山上。谢尔坎发出可怕的咆哮声，大步离开了他们。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon the pack started down the hill to eat the meal promised by the panther. Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli's family stayed behind at the rock. With a furious roar, Shere Khan stalked away from them.

            “想怎么咆哮就怎么咆哮吧，老虎。”&nbsp;巴希拉嘟囔道，“&nbsp;我感觉总有一天，这个人类宝宝毛克利，会让你因为另一个原因咆哮的。”&nbsp;<br>
            阿克拉笑着转头看狼妈妈和狼爸爸。“人类非常有智慧。也许你们的人类宝宝能在某些方面帮助我们狼群。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">

            毛克利越长越大，不断学习森林法则。有一年，干旱非常严重。当几乎不下雨的冬天到来时，开始干旱。山药干巴巴的，树几乎没开花。然后，天慢慢热了起来，酷热使森林变成了黄色、褐色，最后变成了黑色。水坑变成了淤泥。

            Mowgli continued growing and learning the law of the jungle. One year a terrible drought arrived. It began when the winter came, bringing little rain.

            Bamboo stalks grew dry, clanking loudly in the hot wind.<br>

            Hathi, the wise old elephant, lifted his trunk. "There is a water truce!" he declared. Mowgli learned that this meant no one could hunt at the river. Instead everyone could safely drink there. The animals whistled and shrieked, spreading the news of the water truce.

            Baloo looked at Mowgli. "Well, we have someone here who cannot survive much longer without more food. The boy is all skin and bones."<br>
            "Hey!" Mowgli sat up in the water. "That's because I don't have any fur to cover my bones."

            大家都笑了。可是，毛克利瞪着巴鲁说：“你没有毛也会看起来不好看。”&nbsp;<br>
            巴希拉抬起一只爪子轻轻地把毛克利推到了水里。毛克利站起来，边吐水边大笑。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone laughed, but Mowgli was scowling at Baloo. "You wouldn't look good without fur either!"<br>
            Bagheera put out a paw and gently knocked Mowgli back into the water. Mowgli rose, spluttering and laughing.

            “你这样逗你老师，太没礼貌了，毛克利。”&nbsp;巴希拉说。他扑哧一笑，又把毛克利推到了水里。<br>
            这次当毛克利从水里站起来时，他看见巴希拉的表情变了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's rude to make fun of your teacher, Mowgli," Bagheera said. Grinning, he dunked Mowgli again.<br>
            This time when Mowgli rose from the water, he saw that Bagheera's expression had changed.

            “呃哦。”&nbsp;他想。他看见老虎在朝他们慢慢走过来。<br>

            毛克利悄悄退到巴希拉身后，谢尔坎把下巴放进河里喝水。很快，河面上就泛起了油乎乎的水纹。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Uh-oh," he thought. He saw the tiger slinking toward them.<br>
            "Why, look at this." Shere Khan's voice was a low rumble. He bent to take a drink. "It's the man cub."<br>
            Mowgli sneakily hid behind Bagheera, and Shere Khan dipped his chin in the river water to drink. Soon dark oily streaks were floating in the water.

            Bagheera looked suspiciously at the oily streaks. "What have you been up to, Shere Khan?"<br>
            Shere Khan smiled slyly. "I found a human," he said. "So I came to the river for a drink—and to clean myself."

            干旱终于过去了。老棕熊巴鲁已经教了毛克利很多森林法则。毛克利还跟狼们学到了很重要的东西。<br>
            狼爸爸教毛克利注意声音。“森林里的每个声音都有意义。要仔细听草的声音和猫头鹰唱歌。猫头鹰会告诉你什么时候有危险。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The drought finally passed. The old bear, Baloo, had already taught Mowgli many things about the law of the jungle. Mowgli learned important lessons from the wolves too.<br>
            Father Wolf taught Mowgli to pay attention to sounds. "Every sound in the jungle means something. Listen carefully to the rustle of the grass and the owls' song. The owls can tell you when danger is coming."

            毛克利的狼兄弟们教毛克利如何观察其他动物的行为。蝙蝠休息之前挠树。鱼饿了就会在水池里跳。<br>
            同时，树上的猴子们一整天都在观察毛克利。他们看见他用树枝盖了一个窝棚。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli's wolf brothers showed Mowgli how to watch how other animals acted. Bats scratched the trees before they rested. Fish splashed in the pools when they were hungry.<br>
            Meanwhile the monkeys, up in the trees, watched Mowgli all day long. They saw him weaving sticks to make a shelter.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们看见他用小石子盖了一个小屋子，在淤泥里踩来踩去。毛克利其实是在玩儿，就像所有他那么大的孩子一样。但是，猴子们不知道他只是在玩儿。所以，他们惊奇地盯着毛克利。<br>
            “那个人类孩子非常聪明，多才多艺。”&nbsp;一个猴子说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They watched him build little huts from rocks and stomp in the mud. Mowgli was just playing, like all children of his age. But the monkeys didn't know it was just play. So they watched his movements with awe.<br>
            "The man cub is very wise, with so many talents," one monkey said.

            “嘿！”&nbsp;另一个猴子说，“也许他可以当我们的首领！”&nbsp;<br>

            一个炎热的下午，猴子们看见毛克利在和巴希拉、巴鲁一起睡午觉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hey!" another monkey said. "Maybe he can be our leader!"<br>
            "Yes," another added. "Everybody in the jungle will envy us if he's our leader. Let's find a way to bring him to Monkey City!"<br>
            One hot afternoon the monkeys spotted Mowgli napping with Bagheera and Baloo.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是我们偷来那个人类孩子的机会。”&nbsp;一只猴子低声说，“我们走吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            一群猴子扑了过去。接下来毛克利知道的是，几只手抓住了他的腿和胳膊。然后，两只力气最大的猴子抓住毛克利逃走了。树枝刮了他的脸。紧接着，他听见了巴鲁的声音。熊的叫声惊醒了整个森林。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This is our chance to steal the man cub," a monkey whispered. "Let's go!"<br>
            A group of monkeys swooped down. The next thing Mowgli knew, hands were grabbing his legs and arms. Then the two strongest monkeys grabbed Mowgli and swung off. Branches scratched his face. Then he heard Baloo. The bear's loud cry woke up the entire jungle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            猴子们大笑。他们越过树梢。<br>
            “哇啊！”&nbsp;毛克利觉得头晕。树枝和叶子拍打着他的脸。猴子们蹦蹦跳跳，大喊大叫，穿过了森林。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monkeys just laughed. They flew through the treetops.<br>
            "Whoa!" Mowgli felt dizzy. Branches and leaves slapped his face. The monkeys bounded, yelling as they went through the jungle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “放我走！”&nbsp;毛克利大喊道。他们在高高的树上。毛克利担心猴子们会把他扔下去。然后，他开始生气、思考。<br>
            “巴鲁和巴希拉会找我的。”&nbsp;他想。但是，猴子们跑得太快了，毛克利的朋友们可能追不上。他怎样才能留下线索告诉朋友们他在哪儿呢？
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let me go!" Mowgli cried. They were up high in the trees. He was terrified that the monkeys would drop him. Then he grew angry and started to think.<br>
            "Baloo and Bagheera will try to find me," he thought. But the monkeys were traveling so fast, Mowgli's friends couldn't possibly catch up. How could he leave them a clue about where he was?
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            朝下看也没有用。那只让毛克利觉得头晕。所以，他朝上看。在上面远远的蓝天上，他看见了老鹰——兰。兰飞在森林上空找吃的。<br>
            兰终于朝下看，看见了猴子们。“嗯？”&nbsp;他说，“那些猴子抓着什么东西吗？”&nbsp;他俯冲下去，想要看清楚。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was useless to look down. That made Mowgli dizzy. So he looked up. And there, far away in the blue sky, he saw Rann, the hawk. Rann was flying over the jungle, searching for something to eat.<br>
            Rann finally looked down and spotted the monkeys. "Hmm," he said. "Are those monkeys holding onto something?" He swooped down to get a better look.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利当然知道森林里的所有语言。他吹了一声很响的口哨。<br>
            “啊？”&nbsp;兰很惊讶，他吹哨回应。“毛克利？是你吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “兰！跟着我！”&nbsp;毛克利朝老鹰喊道，“然后，告诉巴鲁和巴希拉我在哪儿！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli, of course, knew all the languages of the jungle. He let out a loud whistle.<br>
            "Huh?" Surprised, Rann whistled back. "Mowgli? Is that you?"<br>
            "Rann! Follow me!" Mowgli shouted to the hawk. "Then tell Baloo and Bagheera where I am!"

            巴希拉爬上树去追毛克利，但猴子们太快了。然后，细树枝承受不住黑豹的体重。巴希拉滑了下去，脚指甲里全是树皮。<br>

            “你那个速度连受伤的牛都追不上。”&nbsp;巴希拉说，“坐着别动，我们来做个计划。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera had climbed the tree after Mowgli, but the monkeys were too fast. Then the thin branches snapped beneath his weight. The panther slipped down, his claws full of bark.<br>
            Baloo had set off at a clumsy run. "Come on, Bagheera!"<br>
            "You couldn't catch a wounded cow at that pace," Bagheera said. "Sit still and let's make a plan."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Baloo dropped to the ground. "This is terrible!" he moaned, rolling around.<br>

            巴希拉低下了头。“叫你黄蚯蚓，还有别的难听的名字。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我要去提醒他们说点儿我的好话！”&nbsp;卡阿厉声说道，“他们去哪儿了？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And they are foolish and lazy." He swung toward Bagheera. "What do the monkeys call me—a yellow fish?"<br>
            Bagheera lowered his head. "They call you a yellow earthworm, and there are other names too that are hard to listen to."<br>

            “看见了吧？”&nbsp;巴希拉说道，“我告诉过你，他非常聪明。不过，我们最好马上去猴子城。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Baloo grinned proudly as Rann flew off. "Mowgli remembered the hawk's language! And he found a way to send us a message."<br>
            "See?" Bagheera said. "I told you that he's very smart. But we'd better get to Monkey City right away."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大家都知道猴子城在哪儿，但几乎没有森林动物去过。那是一个森林深处被废弃的老城。只有猴子喜欢使用人类用过的地方。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone knew where Monkey City was, but few jungle animals went there. It was an old deserted city, buried in the jungle. Only the monkeys liked to use places once used by people.<br>
            "It is half a night's journey—at full speed," Bagheera said, glancing at the old bear.

            巴鲁急急忙忙跟在卡阿和巴希拉的后面，但很快，他就停下来气喘吁吁。巴希拉一直跑着，卡阿好像把身体贴在地上一样。蟒蛇找到了穿过森林的捷径，他目光坚定，沿路前行。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Baloo hurried after Kaa and Bagheera, but soon he stopped, panting. Bagheera kept running, while Kaa seemed to pour himself along the ground. The snake found the quickest route through the jungle with his steady eyes and followed it.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利仔细看着猴子城。这里已经成了一片废墟。但是，很久以前一个国王建起了这座城。大理石墙的内外长着树，野生藤蔓挂在窗户框上。山顶上有一座没有屋顶的宫殿。宫殿下面是一排排房子和空坑。地上是寺庙破碎的圆顶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli looked around Monkey City. It was in ruins now. But some king had built it long ago. Trees grew in and out of marble walls, and wild vines hung from windows. There was a palace with no roof at the top of the hill. Below the palace were rows of houses and empty pits. Shattered domes from temples lay on the ground.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            猴子们叫这个地方&nbsp;“猴子城”&nbsp;。但是，他们不知道怎么使用人类建筑。他们坐在大理石房间里抓跳蚤。他们沿着露台跑来跑去，摇晃橙子树，只为了看水果掉下来。他们在蓄水池里喝水、打架。每隔一段时间，猴子们会厌倦这座城市。然后，他们就会回到树梢上去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monkeys called this place Monkey City. Yet they had no idea how to use the people's buildings. They sat inside the marble rooms and picked fleas. They raced along the terrace, shaking orange trees, just to watch the fruit fall. They drank and fought at the water tanks. Every once in a while, the monkeys got tired of the city. Then they went back to the treetops.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天，猴子们很晚才到了猴子城。虽然走了很远的路，但他们没去睡觉，而是手拉手跳起了舞。一只猴子还讲了一段很长的话。<br>
            “这个人类孩子将改变猴子的历史！”&nbsp;他宣布，“这个男孩儿将告诉我们怎么把树枝编在一起。我们能盖房子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monkeys reached the city late in the day. Instead of going to sleep after the long journey, the monkeys joined hands and danced. One monkey even made a long speech.<br>
            "This man cub is going to change monkey history!" he announced. "This boy will show us how to weave sticks together. We can build houses."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利叹了一口气，开始把一些树枝编到一起。几只猴子试图模仿他做。可他们一只接一只地觉得无聊，站了起来。一些猴子开始拉朋友们的尾巴。另一些唱着歌跳来跳去。<br>
            终于，&nbsp;毛克利放弃了。他放下树枝。“我饿了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            With a sigh, Mowgli began to weave some sticks together. A few monkeys tried to do just what he was doing. But one by one, they got bored and jumped up. Some started pulling friends' tails. Others jumped around, singing.<br>
            Finally Mowgli gave up and put down the sticks. "I'm hungry!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            二十只猴子跳起来要去给毛克利拿坚果。他们在路上就打了起来，把食物的事情忘得一干二净。<br>
            “巴鲁是对的。”&nbsp;毛克利想，“猴子们没有规则，也没有头领。他们只知道偷东西和唱歌。我要回家！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Twenty monkeys jumped up to bring him nuts. They started fighting on the way—and forgot all about the food.<br>
            "Baloo was right," Mowgli thought. "Monkeys have no laws and no leader. All they do is steal and sing. I'm going home!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利站起来向大门走去，但猴子们一下子就拽住了他。<br>
            “哦！不行！你得跟我们在一起！”&nbsp;<br>
            “你为什么想走？”&nbsp;一只猴子说，“我们是森林里最棒的动物。我们会告诉你我们有多棒！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli jumped to his feet and headed toward the gate. But the monkeys quickly pulled him back.<br>
            "Oh no! You're staying with us!"<br>
            "Why do you want to leave?" a monkey said. "We're the most wonderful creatures in the jungle. We'll tell you all about how great we are!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所有的猴子都聚到露台听那个愚蠢的故事。毛克利忍不住笑起来。<br>
            “我很好奇他们睡不睡觉。”&nbsp;他想。他抬头看，发现一朵云彩正在滑向月亮。很快，天就会完全黑下来。到时候，他将再次尝试逃跑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            All the monkeys were gathering on the terrace to listen to the silly stories. Mowgli couldn't help laughing. <br>
            "I wonder if they ever sleep," he thought. He looked up to see a cloud sliding toward the moon. Soon it would be completely dark. He'd try again to escape then.

            巴希拉和卡阿终于到了猴子城的城边。他们能看见猴子们围着毛克利。<br>
            他们溜到了沟里。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera and Kaa finally reached the edge of Monkey City. They could see Mowgli in a circle with monkeys surrounding him.<br>
            The two friends slipped into a ditch.<br>
            "I wish Baloo was here," Bagheera whispered. "But we will do what we can." He looked up at the sky.

            猴子们还在吹牛。<br>
            毛克利看见天黑了。突然，他听到了什么声音。是巴希拉轻轻踩踏露台的声音。“成功了！”&nbsp;他心想，“我的计划成功了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "When that cloud covers the moon, I'll go to the terrace."<br>
            "Good luck," Kaa whispered. "I will go over the west wall." Then he glided away.<br>
            The monkeys were still giving boastful speeches.<br>
            Mowgli saw it was getting dark. Suddenly he heard something—Bagheera's light feet on the marble terrace. "It worked!" Mowgli thought. "My plan worked!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            黑豹咆哮了一声，冲到了前面。他左右出击，攻击猴子们。受惊的动物们又怕又气，大声嚎叫。<br>
            终于，一只猴子踢了巴希拉一脚。“只有一个进攻者！”&nbsp;她喊道，“大家抓住他！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            With a furious roar, the panther rushed forward. He darted right and left, striking monkeys. The startled creatures howled with fright and rage.<br>
            Finally a monkey managed to kick Bagheera. "There's only one attacker!" she shouted. "Let's get him!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一群猴子围住了巴希拉。他们又咬又挠，又撕又拉。同时，有两只猴子抓住了毛克利。他们把毛克利拽到寺庙的墙上。然后，他们把他推进了圆顶上的一个洞里。<br>
            如果是人类养大的男孩儿，掉到寺庙地上，会受伤的。但毛克利按照巴鲁教他的办法摔下去，双脚着地。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A mass of monkeys surrounded Bagheera. They were biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling. Meanwhile, two monkeys grabbed Mowgli. They dragged him up the wall of a temple. Then they pushed him through a hole in its broken dome.<br>
            A boy raised by humans would have gotten hurt in the fall to the temple floor. But Mowgli fell exactly as Baloo had taught him. He landed on his feet.

            "Stay in there," a monkey said. "We'll be back after we get rid of your friends!"<br>
            Now Mowgli could hear Kaa. He quickly gave the snake's call.<br>
            There were other snakes inside the ruins. They hissed back at him. "Stand still, Little Brother. Please don't step on us!"

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through a hole. He listened to the furious sound of Bagheera fighting.<br>
            "Baloo must be here too," Mowgli thought. Bagheera would not have come without him. "But right now Bagheera could use some help from me."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Go to the water tank, Bagheera," he shouted. "Get to the water!"<br>
            Bagheera heard Mowgli's cry. "Thank goodness!" the panther thought, fighting his way toward the tanks. "The man cub is safe!"<br>
            Suddenly a shout rose. It was Baloo.

            “巴希拉！我在这里！”&nbsp;<br>

            毛克利听见撞击声，接着是落水声。巴希拉跑进蓄水池里去了！猴子们不会跟着他进去的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bagheera! I'm here!"<br>
            The old bear panted as he climbed the terrace. He threw himself onto his rear legs and held out his paws. Then he began to hit away monkeys. Bat-bat-bat!<br>
            Mowgli heard a crash, followed by a splash. Bagheera had made it to the water tank! The monkeys would not follow him in there.

            黑豹气喘吁吁，头刚刚露出水面。猴子们气得在台阶上上蹿下跳。猴子们做好了准备，如果巴希拉出来帮助巴鲁，他们就扑向巴希拉。<br>
            “卡阿在哪儿？”&nbsp;巴希拉想。那条蟒蛇走了吗？他抬起滴水的下巴，发出蛇叫声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The panther gasped for breath, his head just out of the water. Monkeys stood on the steps, dancing up and down with rage. They were ready to spring on him when he came out to help Baloo.<br>
            "Where's Kaa?" Bagheera thought. Had the snake left? He lifted his dripping chin and gave the snake's call.

            卡阿花了很长时间才越过西墙。他卷曲、伸直身体，以保证身体的每个部位都用得上。同时，巴鲁打了几只猴子。蝙蝠在他们上面飞来飞去，带来了大战的消息。然后，大象哈提大喊，叫醒了鸟儿们和更多的猴子们。森林动物们开始飞快地向猴子城跑去。

            It had taken Kaa a long time to get over the west wall. He coiled and uncoiled himself, to be sure that every bit of his long body was working. Meanwhile, Baloo fought some monkeys. The bat flew back and forth above them, telling news of the battle. Then Hathi the elephant trumpeted loudly, waking up birds and more monkeys. Jungle animals began racing toward Monkey City.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            All at once Kaa came—ready to deliver a crushing blow. The python's first strike drove into the heart of the crowd around Baloo. He didn't need to strike again. For all at once the monkeys scattered.<br>
            "It's Kaa!" they cried. "Run!"

            “嘶嘶嘶”&nbsp;卡阿的声音把猴子们吓得四处逃散。一些猴子从来没见过卡阿。但是，他们都听说过关于可怕蟒蛇的故事。他能像长苔藓一样悄无声息地沿着树枝溜走。<br>
            猴子逃跑时，巴鲁安心地松了一口气。和猴子们大战后，他觉得全身酸痛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ssss!" Kaa hissed as the monkeys ran in terror. Some of the monkeys had never met Kaa before. But they'd all heard stories about the terrifying python. He could slip along branches as quietly as moss grows.<br>
            As the monkeys fled, Baloo drew in a deep breath of relief. He was sore and battered after fighting them.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            巴希拉也受伤了。黑豹爬出了蓄水池，甩了甩他湿乎乎的毛。<br>
            “在那些猴子再进攻以前，我们去接毛克利吧。”&nbsp;巴希拉说。<br>
            “我在这儿时，他们不会再进攻的！”&nbsp;卡阿嘶了一声。“那个人类孩子在哪儿呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera was hurt too. The panther climbed out of the water tank and shook out his wet fur.<br>
            "Let's get Mowgli before those monkeys attack again," Bagheera said.<br>
            "They will not attack again while I'm here!" Kaa hissed. "Where is the man cub anyway?"

            “我在这里！”&nbsp;毛克利在圆顶里跳舞。“我被困了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “请把这孩子从这里弄出去。”&nbsp;毛克利脚边的蛇说，“他会踩到我们孩子的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “退后，毛克利。”&nbsp;卡阿命令道。&nbsp;蟒蛇仔细地看了看圆顶。终于，他发现大理石上有一条裂缝。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "In here!" Mowgli danced around inside the dome. "I'm trapped!"<br>
            "Please get him out of here," said a snake at his feet. "He will crush our young."<br>
            "Stand back, Mowgli," Kaa ordered. The python looked carefully at the dome. Finally he spotted a crack in the marble.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，蟒蛇高高地抬起身体，不停地撞击大理石。<br>
            “哇！”&nbsp;当大理石在一团尘土中破碎时，巴希拉惊叫起来。<br>
            毛克利跳出来，扑到了巴鲁和巴希拉怀里。<br>
            “你没事儿吧？”&nbsp;巴鲁问道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then, lifting his body high above the ground, he smashed down again and again. <br>
            "Whoa!" Bagheera exclaimed as the marble shattered in a cloud of dust.<br>
            Mowgli leaped out and threw himself at Baloo and Bagheera.<br>
            "Are you okay?" Baloo asked.

            卡阿盯着毛克利。“所以，你就是那个人类孩子。为什么你看起来像只猴子？”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利鞠躬。“谢谢您救了我的命和我朋友们的命。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不客气。”&nbsp;卡阿温柔地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm sore and hungry," Mowgli replied. "But I'm fine."<br>
            Kaa stared at Mowgli. "So you're the man cub. Why do you look like a monkey?"<br>
            Mowgli bowed. "Thank you for saving my life and my friends' lives."<br>
            "It's nothing," Kaa said softly.

            这时，月亮已经落山了。猴子们躲在石墙后面，不停地发抖。卡阿爬进露台中央，啪地一声闭上了嘴。猴子们吓坏了，看着他慢慢跳起舞。<br>
            “这是我的舞蹈，叫做&nbsp;‘卡阿的饥饿’。坐着别动，看着我！”&nbsp;蛇命令道。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            By now the moon had sunk behind the hills. The monkeys were still trembling behind stone walls. Kaa glided into the center of the terrace and closed his jaws with a snap. Terrified, the monkeys watched him begin a slow dance.<br>
            "This is my dance called the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still and watch me!" the snake commanded.

            卡阿嘶嘶地说：“靠近点儿，猴子们......”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Kaa wove his head from right to left. He made slow loops with his body. His scales rustled.<br>
            Mowgli stood with Baloo and Bagheera. His eyes flicked from the monkeys to his friends. Everyone was watching the snake with wonder.<br>
            Kaa hissed. "Come closer, monkeys . . ."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            猴子们无助地摇摇晃晃向前走。巴鲁和巴希拉也开始向前走。毛克利朝朋友们扑过去。“快！”&nbsp;他边拽朋友们边喊，“我们离开这里吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            这两只巨兽一惊，好像毛克利刚把他们从梦中叫醒一样。然后，他们逃到稍微远一点的地方。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monkeys swayed forward helplessly. Baloo and Bagheera started to walk forward too. Mowgli sprang toward them. "Come on!" he cried, yanking them away. "Let's get out of here!"<br>
            The two great beasts jumped as if Mowgli had just woken them from a dream. Then they ran a short distance away.

            巴希拉回头看了一眼蛇，吓得发抖。“&nbsp;不只是猴子们害怕卡阿。那条蛇也让我紧张。”&nbsp;<br>
            巴鲁抖了抖毛。“事情很顺利。我们又找到了毛克利。”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的，但这次小冒险让我们付出了代价。”&nbsp;巴希拉严肃地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera glanced back at the snake and shuddered. "The monkeys aren't the only ones who are scared of Kaa. That snake makes me nervous."<br>
            Baloo shook out his fur. "It worked out fine. We have Mowgli again."<br>
            "True, but this little adventure cost us," Bagheera said sternly.

            “我们俩都受伤了，这会让我们几天没法打猎。还有，我们不得不求卡阿帮忙。”&nbsp;他瞪着毛克利。“我们警告过你，跟猴子们玩儿很愚蠢。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利低下了头。“对不起。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We're both injured. Which means we cannot hunt for several days. And we had to get Kaa's help." He glared at Mowgli. "We warned you about this. We told you it was foolish to play with the monkeys." <br>
            Mowgli looked down. "I'm sorry."

            “破坏规则时，作为惩罚，道歉是不够的。”&nbsp;巴希拉回答道。说完，他轻轻拍了几下毛克利的肩膀。<br>
            “嘿！”&nbsp;巴希拉说，“行了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He's very young," Baloo said. "And he's sorry for what he's done."<br>
            "Being sorry is not enough punishment for breaking the rules!" Bagheera replied. With that, he gave Mowgli some light taps on the shoulder.<br>
            "There," Bagheera said. "That's done."

    <div>

            “好的。”&nbsp;毛克利爬到巴希拉背上，把头靠在了上面。很快，他就睡着了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            According to the law of the jungle, a punishment settled things. There was no need to say anything more about Mowgli's mistake with the monkeys.<br>
            "Jump on my back, Little Brother," Bagheera said. "We will go home."<br>
            "Okay." Mowgli climbed onto Bagheera's back and lay down his head. Soon he was fast asleep.

            从猴子城回来后，毛克利幸福地住在狼群里。他越长越高，越长越壮。他打猎，游泳。他晒太阳，吃了睡，睡了吃。<br>
            在岩石会议上，狼们经常会让毛克利给他们拔爪子上的尖刺。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After his return from Monkey City, Mowgli lived happily among the wolf pack. He grew taller and stronger. He hunted and swam. He sat in the sun, and he ate and slept—then ate and slept again.<br>
            At Council Rock the wolves often asked Mowgli to pull sharp thorns from their paws.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每次毛克利拔刺，他都会发现一件怪事。如果他盯着狼看，狼就会马上避开视线。<br>
            “好奇怪。”&nbsp;他想，“狼们怕我吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利有时候会在森林里看见谢尔坎。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli noticed something strange whenever he did it. If he stared at the wolves, they quickly looked away.<br>
            "That's odd," he thought. "Are the wolves afraid of me?"<br>
            Mowgli sometimes saw Shere Khan in the jungle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利想和他保持距离。但是，很多年轻的狼开始效忠谢尔坎。那老虎把剩下的食物扔给他们。他还称赞他们。<br>
            “你们真是优秀、勇敢的猎手啊！”&nbsp;谢尔坎温和地说道，“我不知道为什么你们让阿克拉领导你们。他又老又弱。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli tried to keep his distance. But many of the young wolves were growing loyal to Shere Khan. The tiger tossed them scraps of food. He praised them too.<br>
            "What fine, brave hunters you are!" Shere Khan purred. "I don't know why you let Akela lead you. He's getting so old and weak."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “总有一天，毛克利会领导狼群的。”&nbsp;一只年轻的狼说道，“那个人类孩子非常聪明。”&nbsp;<br>
            “他甚至能从我们爪子里拔出刺。”&nbsp;另一只狼说。<br>
            “又是那个人类男孩儿！”&nbsp;谢尔坎咆哮道，“他不如你们其中任何一只厉害！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Mowgli might lead the pack one day," a young wolf said. "The man cub is very smart."<br>
            "He can even remove thorns from our paws," another wolf said.<br>
            "That man cub again!" Shere Khan growled. "He is no better than any of you!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一些狼也开始咆哮：“你是对的，谢尔坎。毛克利连狼都不是！”&nbsp;<br>
            巴希拉看着狼群里发生的这一切。他对此很不满意。<br>
            “毛克利，我告诉你多少次谢尔坎是你的敌人了？”&nbsp;一天下午，他问道。两个朋友在温暖的阳光下，躺在树叶上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Some of the wolves growled too. "You're right, Shere Khan. Mowgli is not even a wolf!"<br>
            Bagheera watched what was happening within the wolf pack. And he didn't like it.<br>
            "Mowgli, how many times have I told you that Shere Khan is your enemy?" he asked one afternoon. The two friends were lying on some leaves in the warm sun.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利笑了。“就像那棵树上的坚果那么多！”&nbsp;他摇了摇头。巴希拉总是警告他，给他建议。<br>
            “好，你听好了。”&nbsp;巴希拉说道，“阿克拉越来越老了。很快，他就会弱得无法领导狼群。到时候，年轻的狼们会采取行动。他们会试图把你赶出狼群。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli laughed. "As many times as there are nuts on that tree!" He shook his head. Bagheera was always giving him warnings and advice.<br>
            "Well, listen carefully," Bagheera said. "Akela is getting old. Soon he will be too weak to lead the pack. That's when the younger wolves will take action. They will try to throw you out of the pack."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他们不会把我赶出狼群的！”&nbsp;毛克利还是笑。“我住在森林里，我遵守森林法则。我甚至还帮我的兄弟姐妹们拔爪子上的刺。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那些事情都是事实。”&nbsp;巴希拉坚定地说，“但是，你不是狼。你是人类。总有一天，你会和人类住到一起的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They won't throw me out of the pack!" Mowgli was still laughing. "I live in the jungle. I obey its law. I even pull thorns from my brothers' and sisters' paws."<br>
            "Those things are true," Bagheera said firmly. "But you're not a wolf. You're a human. And someday you will live among them."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不那么认为，巴希拉。”&nbsp;毛克利打了一个哈欠。“有时候，我去山顶观察人类的村庄。但我从来没跟村民们说过话。我不跟他们一起打猎。总之，你一辈子都生活在森林里。你不了解人类。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't think so, Bagheera." Mowgli yawned. "Sometimes I go to the hill to look down at the people's village. But I never talk to the villagers. I don't hunt with them. Anyway, you've lived in the jungle for your whole life. You don't know anything about people."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            黑豹换了一下爪子的姿势，扭过头。“很抱歉我说这些话。”&nbsp;他说，“但是，大多数狼都恨你。他们认为你比他们更聪明、更健壮。所以，当你盯着他们看时，他们会扭过头去。他们是你的敌人。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;毛克利感到刺痛，好像一只蜜蜂落在了他的皮肤上。他跳了起来。“我以为他们是我的朋友！巴希拉，我该怎么办？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The panther shifted his paws and looked away. "I'm sorry to say this," he said. "But most of the wolves hate you. They think you're wiser and stronger than they are. That's why they turn away when you stare at them. They are your enemies."<br>
            "What?" Mowgli felt stung, as if a bee had landed on his skin. He leaped up. "I thought they were my friends! Bagheera, what should I do?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你一定要保护你自己。”&nbsp;巴希拉说道，“阿克拉领导不了多久狼群了。一旦他在打猎中失败，年轻的狼们就会背叛他。他们会到岩石会议上去......我知道该怎么办了！”&nbsp;巴希拉笑了。“你要下山到山谷里的人类村庄去。带回几朵人类在那里种的红花。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You must protect yourself," Bagheera said. "Akela is not going to be able to lead the pack for much longer. As soon as he fails at hunting, the young wolves will turn against him. They'll go to Council Rock, and—I've got it!" Bagheera smiled. "You must go down to the humans' village in the valley. Get some of the red flower, which they grow there."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “红花？”&nbsp;毛克利重复道。森林里的所有野兽都害怕人类的火。“黄昏时分，红花在他们的小屋外生长。我可以弄到一些。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好！”&nbsp;巴希拉点头说道，“快点弄来一些放在身边。等时机到了，你就可以用强大武器做好准备了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The red flower?" Mowgli repeated. Every beast in the jungle lived in fear of the humans' fire. "The red flower grows outside their huts at twilight. I could try to get some."<br>
            "Good!" Bagheera nodded. "Get it quickly and keep it nearby. When the time comes, you will be ready with a mighty weapon."

            不一会儿，毛克利回到了山洞。狼妈妈觉得有什么不对劲。“怎么了，儿子？”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利不想跟狼妈妈谈别的狼们。“哦，有只蝙蝠在聊谢尔坎。他在附近打猎。所以，我打算今晚在人类的田地附近打猎。”&nbsp;说完，毛克利就匆匆离开，穿过灌木丛向下跑去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later Mowgli returned to the cave. Mother Wolf sensed something was wrong. "What is it, son?"<br>
            Mowgli didn't want to tell her about the other wolves. "Oh, some bat was chattering about Shere Khan. He's hunting nearby, so I think I'll hunt near the people's fields tonight." With that, Mowgli hurried away, racing downward through the bushes.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在山谷底的小溪附近，他听见了喊声。是狼们在打猎。<br>
            “跳上去！阿克拉！”&nbsp;一只年轻的狼喊道，“让我们看看你的力量！”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利听见牙齿折断的声音，然后是一声尖叫。阿克拉跑向了什么，却错过了。毛克利朝村庄跑去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Near the stream at the bottom of the valley, he heard howls. The wolves were hunting.<br>
            "Spring, Akela!" a young wolf shouted. "Show your strength!"<br>
            Mowgli heard teeth snapping and then a yelp. Akela had sprung at something—and missed. Mowgli raced on toward the village.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利从来没有离村庄这么近过。他悄悄地走进一个村舍，仔细地朝里面看去。<br>
            红花在一面墙上闪闪发光。毛克利看见一个女人起身吹了一下红花。然后，女人往红花里放了些树枝。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli had never come this close to the village before. He slipped over to a hut and peered inside.<br>
            A red flower glowed along one wall. He watched a woman get up and blow on it. Then she fed it some sticks.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利叹了口气。红花很危险。他该怎么办呢？<br>
            他等了一个晚上。第二天早上，他看见一个小孩儿拿起了一个火盆。那个男孩儿在里面放满了一块块火红的花。<br>
            毛克利笑了。“那个小男孩儿能碰那红花。”&nbsp;他想，“那我也能！”&nbsp;
        </div>

            Mowgli sighed. The red flower was dangerous. What should he do?<br>
            He waited through the night. In the morning he saw a child pick up a pot. The boy filled it with lumps of the red-hot flower.<br>
            Mowgli laughed. "That small cub can handle the red flower," he thought. "So can I!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利冲向男孩儿，抢走了那个火盆。然后，他朝森林深处跑去。过了一会儿，毛克利停下来，像那个女人那样朝红色东西吹气。“现在，该给它吃东西了。”&nbsp;毛克利往红花上放了树枝和树皮。很快，红花就又燃烧起来。<br>
            毛克利笑了。“我成功了！”&nbsp;<br>
            走到半山坡的时候，他见到了巴希拉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He ran at the boy and grabbed the pot. Then he ran deep into the jungle. After some time he stopped to blow at the red stuff as the woman had done. "Now it's time to feed it." He dropped twigs and bark on the red flower. It quickly bloomed again.<br>
            Mowgli grinned. "I did it!"<br>
            Halfway up the hill he met Bagheera.

            黑豹看起来很担心。“阿克拉昨晚打猎失败了。狼们想杀了他，但他们在找你呢。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我在山谷里来着。我准备好战斗了。”&nbsp;毛克利举起了装着火的火盆。<br>
            巴希拉点了点头。“很好。”&nbsp;然后，他更仔细地看了看那红花。“你怕这个东西吗？它开花的时候，很危险。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The panther looked worried. "Akela failed at last night's hunt. The wolves wanted to kill him, but they were looking for you instead."<br>
            "I was in the valley. I am ready to fight now." Mowgli held up the fire pot.<br>
            Bagheera nodded. "Good." Then he peered more closely at the red flower. "Are you afraid of that thing? It's dangerous when it blooms."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利耸了耸肩。“我不害怕，实际上，我很久以前就记得它。在我成为狼之前，我在离红花很近的地方休息，又暖和，又幸福。”&nbsp;<br>
            那天晚上，毛克利朝狼群会议走去。他站在后面，狼群看不见火盆。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli shrugged. "I'm not afraid. In fact, I remember it from long ago. Before I was a wolf, I rested near the red flower. It was warm and pleasant."<br>
            That night Mowgli headed to the pack council. He stayed in the back so the wolves wouldn't see the fire pot.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利看见空荡荡的岩石，咽了一口口水。在打猎中受伤的阿克拉躺在岩石旁边。他从头狼的位子上被赶下来了！<br>
            谢尔坎从岩石后面走了出来，年轻的狼们跟着他。当全体都到时，谢尔坎开始讲话。<br>
            “他没有权利在这里讲话！”&nbsp;巴希拉生气地对毛克利低声说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli gulped when he saw the empty rock. Akela lay beside it, injured from the hunt. The pack was removing him as leader!<br>
            Shere Khan walked around the rock, young wolves trailing him. When everyone had gathered, Shere Khan began to speak.<br>
            "He has no right to speak here!" Bagheera whispered furiously to Mowgli.

            阿克拉慢慢地抬起了头。“我又弱又老。另一只狼要和我战斗，成为狼群的新头狼。”&nbsp;<br>
            狼们沉默了很久，谁也不想和阿克拉战斗。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli sprang to his feet. "Why is he—"<br>
            "Quiet, man cub!" some wolves yelled.<br>
            Akela slowly raised his head. "I'm weak and old. Another wolf must fight me to become the pack's new leader."<br>
            There was a long silence. None wanted to fight Akela.

            “把毛克利交给老虎吧。”&nbsp;一只狼喊道，“毛克利不是狼！”&nbsp;<br>
            阿克拉又抬起头。“毛克利吃我们的食物，跟我们睡在一起。他没有违反森林法则。他是我们的兄弟。”&nbsp;

            "I want only the man cub," Shere Khan roared. "Give me the man cub, and I will leave your pack alone."<br>
            "Let's give Mowgli to the tiger!" a wolf yelled. "Mowgli is not a wolf!"<br>
            Akela lifted his head again. "Mowgli has eaten our food and slept with us. He has not broken the law of the jungle. He's our brother."

            毛克利站直了，把火盆拿给狼群看。“你们经常告诉我，我不是狼。所以，我不会再把你们当做我的兄弟姐妹了！”&nbsp;<br>
            他把火盆扔在地上。红花很快就燃烧了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, he's a man!" the pack snarled. Shere Khan's tail flicked.<br>
            Bagheera glanced at Mowgli. "Now!"<br>
            Mowgli stood upright—showing the fire pot to the pack. "You've often told me that I am not a wolf. So I won't call you my sisters and brothers anymore!"<br>
            He flung the fire pot on the ground. Swiftly it bloomed into furious flames.

            火花在狼周围飞舞。他们吓得后退。<br>
            “我要离开森林！”&nbsp;毛克利喊道，“我要住在村庄里。人类会对我很好。”&nbsp;他走向一堆树枝。“现在，我必须还债。”&nbsp;他抓起一根树枝，在火里点着了它。然后，他朝谢尔坎走去，拿着树枝贴近了老虎的毛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Flames danced near the wolves. They backed away in terror.<br>
            "I'm leaving the jungle!" Mowgli yelled. "I'm going to live in the village. The humans will be kind to me." He stepped toward a pile of sticks. "Now I must pay a debt." He grabbed a stick and lit it from the fire. Then he marched toward Shere Khan and held the stick close to the tiger's fur.

            树枝上的火猛烈地燃烧着。毛克利左右挥舞着树枝，把老虎吓跑了。大部分狼也跑了。当火花落在皮毛上时，他们发出阵阵嚎叫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Remember this, Shere Khan." Mowgli growled. "The next time I come to Council Rock, I will be carrying your hide." He waved the burning stick even closer to the tiger. "And Akela goes free. You will not kill him!"<br>
            The fire burned furiously at the end of the stick. Mowgli waved it right and left, and the frightened tiger ran off. Most of the wolves ran off too, howling as sparks landed on their fur.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            阿克拉和巴希拉急忙走向毛克利。毛克利难过得大口喘气，脸上流着泪水。<br>
            “我怎么了，巴希拉？”&nbsp;他说，“为什么我感觉这么奇怪？”&nbsp;<br>
            “因为你很难过，所以你在哭。只有人类才会像你一样流泪。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Akela and Bagheera hurried over to Mowgli. He was gasping in pain, and tears streamed down his face.<br>
            "What's happening to me, Bagheera?" he said. "Why do I feel so strange?"<br>
            "It's because you're sad. That is why you are crying. Only humans shed tears like yours."

            第二天，年轻的狼们痛苦地嚎叫着，毛克利站在洞口。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli sat and cried for a while. Finally he got up. "I'm going back to the cave now. In the morning I will say farewell to Mother and Father Wolf."<br>
            The next day the young wolves howled miserably as Mowgli stood at the mouth of the cave.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们不会忘了我的，是吧？”&nbsp;毛克利问道。<br>
            “绝对不会！”&nbsp;一只叫格瑞布拉德的狼保证道：“偶尔在山底下见我们吧。我们可以在那里跟你玩儿。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们会想你的，毛克利。”&nbsp;狼妈妈温柔地说道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You won't forget me, will you?" Mowgli said.<br>
            "Never!" the one named Gray Brother promised. "Meet us at the bottom of the hill every once in a while. We can play with you there."<br>
            "We will miss you, Mowgli," Mother said softly.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我很快就会见你们的。”&nbsp;毛克利保证道。然后，他离开了洞，独自一人走下了山坡。<br>
            毛克利沿着山谷的凹凸不平的小路走了几个小时。最后，这条路的尽头出现一片广阔的平原。平原上有很多大石头和大树。成群的牛和水牛在平原上吃草。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I will meet you soon," Mowgli promised. Then he left the cave and went down the hillside alone.<br>
            Mowgli walked for hours along a rough road that ran down the valley. At last, the road opened into a wide plain. The plain was dotted with big rocks and trees. Herds of cattle and buffalo grazed all over the plain.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在远处，毛克利看见了一个村庄。<br>
            几个孩子在放牧。当他们看见毛克利时，吓得大叫着跑开了。<br>
            毛克利饿了，他朝村庄走去。当他走到大门时，一个男人走了出来。毛克利张开嘴，指着嘴里表示他饿了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the distance Mowgli could see a village.<br>
            Several children were in charge of the animal herds. When they saw Mowgli, they shouted in fear and ran away.<br>
            Hungry, Mowgli headed toward the village. When he reached the gate, a man came out. Mowgli opened his mouth and pointed down it to show that he was hungry.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            男人惊讶地看着毛克利，然后转身。他高喊着“村长”&nbsp;跑掉了。<br>
            不一会儿，一个穿着白色衣服的胖男人来到了门口。他的额头上有一个彩色的印记。他的身后是一大群人。他们都盯着毛克利看，对着毛克利指指点点。<br>
            “人类没有礼貌。”&nbsp;毛克利想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The man stared in shock and spun around. He ran away, shouting for the village chief.<br>
            Soon a big, fat man dressed in white came to the gate. He had a colorful mark on his forehead. Behind him was a huge crowd. They all stared and pointed at Mowgli.<br>
            "Humans have no manners," Mowgli thought.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “只有猴子才会这么做！”&nbsp;他朝人群皱了皱眉。<br>
            “没什么好怕的。”&nbsp;村长对人群说。他指着毛克利。“看这孩子胳膊和腿上的这些痕迹，都是狼咬的。他可能是从森林里逃出来的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Only monkeys behave like this!" He frowned at the crowd.<br>
            "There's nothing to be afraid of," the priest said to the crowd. He pointed to Mowgli. "Look at these marks on the boy's arms and legs. They are wolf bites. He has probably run away from the jungle."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “可怜的孩子！”&nbsp;几个女人说道。<br>
            “他是个帅男孩儿。”&nbsp;一个女人说道。<br>
            突然，一个女人倒吸了一口气。“麦苏雅&nbsp;！他看起来像你的儿子！被老虎偷走的那个！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The poor child!" a few women said.<br>
            "He is a handsome boy," a woman said.<br>
            Suddenly one woman gasped. "Messua! He looks like your boy! The one who was stolen by the tiger!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一个手腕和脚踝上戴着铜环的女人走上前。她仔细看着毛克利。“我不确定他是不是我的孩子。”&nbsp;她最后说，“但他看起来确实像我儿子。”&nbsp;<br>
            村长举起双臂。“森林带走了什么，又还回来了！把孩子带回家吧，麦苏雅。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A woman with copper rings on her wrists and ankles stepped forward. She looked closely at Mowgli. "I'm not sure if he's my boy," she said at last. "But he does look like my son."<br>
            The priest threw up his arms. "What the jungle has taken, the jungle has returned! Take the child home, Messua."

            毛克利跟着那个女人进了她的小屋。他很紧张，但那个女人看上去好像很好。小屋里有一张床。他还看到一个大箱子，里面装有谷物和铜锅。墙上挂着神像和一块高高的玻璃。<br>
            当毛克利走到玻璃前，他吓了一跳。“另一个男孩儿住在这里！”&nbsp;他惊奇地想。他举起一只胳膊，玻璃里的男孩儿也举起一只胳膊。毛克利动了动手指。那个男孩儿又一次做了毛克利正在做的动作。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli followed the woman into her hut. He felt nervous, but the woman seemed kind. Inside the hut was a bed. Mowgli saw a large chest, with grain and copper pots stored inside. Hanging on the wall were images of gods and a tall glass.<br>
            When Mowgli stepped in front of the glass, he gasped. "Another boy lives here!" he thought in surprise. He lifted an arm. So did the boy in the glass. Mowgli wiggled his fingers. Again the boy did just what Mowgli was doing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            女人笑了。她指了指毛克利，又指了指镜子。<br>
            “哦！”&nbsp;终于，毛克利明白了。“&nbsp;玻璃里的男孩儿是我！”&nbsp;<br>
            女人给了他一些牛奶和面包。然后，她把手放在他的头上。“拿图？你还记得我给你的鞋吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The woman laughed. She pointed from Mowgli to the mirror.<br>
            "Oh!" Finally Mowgli understood. "That's me in the glass!"<br>
            The woman gave him some milk and bread. Then she lay her hand on his head. "Nathoo? Do you remember the shoes I gave you?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利摇了摇头，听不懂。<br>
            女人摸了摸他的脚，感觉像动物的角一样硬。“不。”&nbsp;她悲伤地说，“这双脚从来没穿过鞋。但你看起来像我的拿图，你将是我的儿子。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利以前从来没在屋顶下呆过。他爬上凳子去摸屋顶上的稻草。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli shook his head, unable to understand.<br>
            The woman touched his foot. It felt as hard as an animal horn. "No," she said sadly. "These feet have never worn shoes. But you look like my Nathoo, and you shall be my son."<br>
            Mowgli had never been under a roof before. He climbed on a stool and touched the roof's straw.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小屋有一个门和一扇窗。如果他觉得自己被困住了，他也会撕了屋顶的稻草。这想法让他心里感觉舒服一些。但还有别的事情困扰着他。<br>
            “我必须学人类的语言。”&nbsp;他意识到，“如果我不理解他们的话，我就不能和他们一起生活。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The hut had a door and a window. But he could also rip the roof's straw if he felt trapped. That thought eased his mind. But something else was bothering him.<br>
            "I must learn the humans' language," he realized. "I cannot live with people if I don’t understand their words."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所以麦苏雅每说一句话，毛克利就重复一遍。天黑以前，他学会了小屋里许多东西的名字。<br>
            睡觉前，麦苏雅和丈夫关上了小屋的门。毛克利感到被困住了。他飞快地从窗子溜走了。<br>
            “我必须把他带回来！”&nbsp;麦苏雅说。&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So as soon as Messua pronounced a word, Mowgli repeated it. Before dark he had learned the names of many things in the hut.<br>
            At bedtime Messua and her husband shut the door to the hut. Mowgli felt trapped. He quickly slipped through a window.<br>
            "I must fetch him!" Messua said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她丈夫拦住了她。“别管他。”&nbsp;他说，“这个男孩儿以前从来没睡过床。如果他真是我们的儿子，他不会逃跑的。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利跑到田边，在高高的草丛里躺了下来。当他快要闭上眼睛时，一个灰色的、软软的鼻子碰了他一下。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Her husband stopped her. "Leave him alone," he said. "The boy has never slept on a bed before. If he is indeed our son, he won't run away."<br>
            Mowgli ran into the field and lay down in some tall grass. Before he could close his eyes, a soft gray nose poked him.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “格瑞布拉德！”&nbsp;毛克利高兴地大喊。<br>

            毛克利笑了。“一切都好吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Gray Brother!" Mowgli cried in delight.<br>
            The wolf sniffed Mowgli. "Yuck!" he said. "This is a terrible reward for following you. You smell like wood smoke and cattle—human smells!"<br>
            Mowgli laughed. "Is everything okay?"

            “不太好。”&nbsp;格瑞布拉德回答道，“我有谢尔坎的消息。他出去打猎了一阵子。但是，那红花把他烧得很厉害。他发誓回来时要把你抓回来。他想把你的骨头放在河里！”&nbsp;<br>
            “他吓不到我。”&nbsp;毛克利说，“总有一天，我会抓住他的！连狼妈妈也说这是事实。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Not exactly," Gray Brother replied. "I have news about Shere Khan. He's gone off to hunt for a while. But the red flower burned him badly. He promises to hunt you down when he returns. He wants to lay your bones in the river!"<br>
            "He doesn't scare me," Mowgli said. "I'm going to hunt him down one day! Even Mother Wolf says that's true."

            Gray Brother looked worried. "Shere Khan is very dangerous, Mowgli. Be careful."<br>

            在之后的三个月里，毛克利没有离开村庄。他忙着学习人类的生活方式和风俗习惯。首先，他发现他必须一直穿着衣服。<br>
            “这太烦人了。”&nbsp;他想。他觉得上衣发痒。他的鞋子夹住了他的脚趾。<br>
            其次，他必须学会数钱，可他一点也不懂。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For the next three months, Mowgli didn’t leave the village. He was too busy learning the ways and customs of humans. First he found out he had to wear clothing all the time.<br>
            "This is so annoying," he thought. His shirt felt itchy. His shoes pinched his toes.<br>
            Then he had to learn how to count money, which he didn't understand at all.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “为什么人类必须互相购买东西？”&nbsp;他问麦苏雅，“在森林里，你可以想拿什么就拿什么。”&nbsp;<br>
            麦苏雅笑了。“&nbsp;这个问题很好。”&nbsp;她说，“我也不知道该如何解释。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why do humans have to buy things from each other?" he asked Messua. "In the jungle you can just take what you want."<br>
            Messua laughed. "That's a good question," she said. "I wouldn't know how to explain it either."

            还有，村里的孩子经常让他生气。当他们一起玩儿游戏时，毛克利一个人站着看。<br>
            女孩儿嘲笑他。“森林男孩儿什么游戏都不会玩儿！”&nbsp;<br>
            “他也不会生火。”&nbsp;其中一个男孩儿说，“他总是说错词。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On top of these things, the village children often made him angry. When they played games together, Mowgli stood by himself and watched.<br>
            The girl laughed at him. "The jungle boy doesn't know how to play any games!"<br>
            "He can't make a fire either," one of the boys added. "And he says the wrong words all the time."

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli felt angry but he stayed quiet. Whenever he got mad, he tried to think of Baloo.<br>
            "The law of the jungle says, keep your temper," the old bear had taught him. "In the jungle your life and food depend on this."

            在这个村庄里，他的生活可能也靠这个。<br>
            一天晚上，毛克利也和别人一样来到了无花果树下&nbsp;。人们见面讲故事，聊天。猴子们坐在无花果树上。他们也聊了几个小时。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Here in the village his life might depend on it too.<br>
            One night Mowgli went under a fig tree like everyone else. People met to tell stories and talk. Monkeys sat in the fig tree's upper branches. They chattered away for hours too.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当人们讲关于神、人和鬼魂的故事时，毛克利听着。布尔迪奥是村里的主要猎手。他讲了关于森林里所有野兽的长篇故事。孩子们听到黑豹、大象和野猪的故事时，眼睛睁得大大的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli listened as the people told tales about gods, humans, and ghosts. Buldeo was the village's chief hunter. He told long stories about all the beasts in the jungle. The children's eyes went wide as they listened to tales about panthers, elephants, and wild pigs.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利忍不住捂住脸。他不想让任何人看到他嘲笑布尔迪奥的愚蠢故事。可当布尔迪奥讲了一个又一个故事时，毛克利忍不住了。他笑得肩膀发抖。<br>
            布尔迪奥开始讲一个新的鬼故事。“这个鬼住在森林老虎的身体里，是老虎偷了麦苏雅的儿子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli had to cover his face. He didn't want anyone to see him laughing at Buldeo's silly tales. But as Buldeo told one story after another, Mowgli couldn't help himself. The boy's shoulders shook with laughter.<br>
            Then Buldeo started a new ghost story. "This ghost lives inside a jungle tiger's body. It's the tiger who stole Messua's son."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “什么？”&nbsp;毛克利喊道。他再也无法安安静静地坐在那里了。“森林老虎不是鬼魂。他是真的。他的名字叫谢尔坎。”&nbsp;<br>
            每个人都转过头盯着毛克利。布尔迪奥惊讶得一时说不出话来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What?" Mowgly said loudly. He couldn't sit there and stay quiet any longer. "The jungle tiger isn't a ghost. He's real. His name is Shere Khan."<br>
            Everyone turned to stare at Mowgli. Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a few moments.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，他瞪着毛克利。“哦！森林小子在说话！如果你这么聪明，为什么不去抓老虎？他的虎皮可是有奖的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “总有一天我会抓住他的。”&nbsp;毛克利小声说。<br>
            猎人嘲笑着说：“从现在起，当你的长辈说话时，你得闭嘴。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then he glared at the boy. "Oh! The jungle brat is speaking up! If you're so wise, why don't you hunt down the tiger? There is a reward for his hide."<br>
            "I will hunt him down one day," Mowgli said under his breath.<br>
            The hunter sneered. "Well, from now on, keep your mouth shut when your elders are speaking."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            几分钟后，毛克利站了起来。“我整晚都在听。”&nbsp;他大声说，“布尔迪奥只说了一两句真话。”&nbsp;<br>
            当毛克利离开时，布尔迪奥非常生气。“这孩子怎么敢这样让我难堪！”&nbsp;他说，“我不会忘记这件事的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A few minutes later, Mowgli got up. "I've been listening all evening," he said loudly. "And Buldeo has spoken only one or two words of truth."<br>
            As Mowgli left, Buldeo grew greatly angry. "How dare the boy embarrass me like that!" the hunter said. "This is not something that I will forget."

            那天晚上，村长拜访了麦苏雅和她的丈夫。他说是时候给毛克利一份工作了。<br>

            That night the village chief visited Messua and her husband. He said it was time to give Mowgli a job.<br>

            几个星期过去了。一天早上，毛克利爬上了拉玛的背。拉玛是水牛群中最大的公牛。别的动物开始跟着拉玛走。<br>
            “今天你们自己放牛吧。”&nbsp;毛克利对其他孩子们说，“我要和水牛呆在一起。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Several weeks passed. One morning Mowgli climbed onto Rama's back. Rama was the largest male in the herd of buffalo. The other animals began following Rama.<br>
            "Graze the cattle on your own today," Mowgli said to the other children. "I'm going to stay with the buffalo."

            毛克利把水牛带到平原边上。那是河流从森林中流出来的地方。然后，他从拉玛的背上跳下来，向竹林跑去。<br>
            正如毛克利期待的那样，格瑞布拉德在那儿等着他。<br>
            他们高兴地拥抱在一起，但格瑞布拉德看起来很担心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli led the buffalo to the edge of the plain. That was where the river came out of the jungle. Then he dropped off Rama's back and ran toward the bamboo.<br>
            Gray Brother was waiting there, just as Mowgli had hoped. <br>
            They hugged one another happily. But Gray Brother looked worried.

            “谢尔坎回到森林里等着你呢。那里几乎没有食物，所以他离开了。他很快就会回来的，毛克利。这次他会杀了你的。”&nbsp;<br>

            "Shere Khan came back to the jungle to wait for you. There was little food, so he left. He will come back soon, Mowgli. And this time he will kill you."<br>

            每天毛克利都放水牛。日复一日，他看着格瑞布拉德坐在平原对面的岩石上。大多数的时候，毛克利只是躺在草地上，按照狼爸爸教他的方式仔细听声音。如果谢尔坎走近，毛克利就一定会在寂静中听见他的声音。<br>
            一天，毛克利看了一眼岩石。那里是空的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Every day Mowgli herded the buffalo. Day after day he saw Gray Brother sitting on the rock across the plain. Most days Mowgli just lay on the grass, listening carefully to the sounds as Father Wolf had taught him. If Shere Khan approached, Mowgli would surely hear him in the stillness.<br>
            One day Mowgli glanced at the rock. It was empty.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他连忙把水牛赶到开着金红色花的树那边。格瑞布拉德坐在那里。他背上的每根毛都竖起来了。<br>
            “谢尔坎已经藏了一个月了。”&nbsp;格瑞布拉德说，“但昨晚他和塔巴其一起穿过了平原。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Quickly he herded the buffalo to the tree with the golden red flowers. There sat Gray Brother. Every hair on his back was standing up.<br>
            "Shere Khan has been hiding for a month," Gray Brother said. "But last night he crossed the plains with Tabaqui."

            毛克利皱起了眉头。“塔巴其？”&nbsp;毛克利不怕谢尔坎。但是，塔巴其是另一回事。那只豺狼非常狡猾。<br>
            “不要害怕。我在黎明时遇见塔巴其，处理掉他了。”&nbsp;格瑞布拉德舔了舔嘴唇。“首先，他告诉了我一些重要的信息。谢尔坎计划今晚在村口等你。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli frowned. "Tabaqui?" Mowgli was not afraid of Shere Khan. However, Tabaqui was another story. The jackal was very cunning.<br>
            "Have no fear. I met Tabaqui at dawn—and took care of him." Gray Brother licked his lips. "First he gave me some important information. Shere Khan plans to wait for you at the village gate tonight."

            "That means he'll be too full to move fast. If there were more of us, we could attack him. But these buffalo will not charge unless they smell him.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Tabaqui must have told him to do that. Shere Khan would not have thought of it alone." Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth.

            Mowgli explained his plan to Akela. Then Akela and Gray Brother got to work. The two wolves ran in and out of the herd of buffalo. They separated the herd into two groups.

            阿克拉嚎叫着，他的队伍出发了。格瑞布拉德开始把母水牛们引向相反的方向。<br>
            同时，一些村里的孩子看着这样的场面。他们带着牛飞快往家跑。“水牛疯了。它们在逃跑！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Akela howled and his group took off. Gray Brother began to lead the females in the opposite direction.<br>
            Meanwhile some of the village children were watching the scene. They hurried home with the cattle as fast as their legs could carry them. "The buffalo have gone mad. They're running away!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利的计划很简单。他计划把谢尔坎困在两群水牛中间的峡谷里。谢尔坎刚刚吃了一顿大餐。他很难战斗或爬上峡谷的两侧。<br>
            毛克利把困惑的公水牛们聚集在峡谷的顶峰。它们站在一个通向峡谷的长满草的斜坡上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli's plan was simple. He planned to trap Shere Khan in the ravine, between the two herds. Shere Khan had just eaten a large meal. It would be hard for him to fight or climb up the sides of the ravine.<br>
            Mowgli rounded up the confused males at the head of the ravine. They stood on a grassy slope that led down to the ravine.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “很好。”&nbsp;毛克利看着峡谷侧壁想。侧壁几乎是垂直的，上面长满了茂密的藤蔓，那会使老虎更难爬出来。<br>
            毛克利举起一只手示意阿克拉。然后，他把手放在嘴里，朝峡谷下大喊：“谢尔坎！”&nbsp;回声从一块石头传到另一块石头上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Good," Mowgli thought, looking at the sides of the ravine. The sides ran nearly straight up and down. Thick vines hung over them. That would make it even harder for the tiger to climb out.<br>
            Mowgli held up a hand to signal Akela. Then he put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine. "Shere Khan!" Echoes jumped from rock to rock.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一声咆哮回答道：“谁在叫我？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是我，毛克利！”&nbsp;他转向阿克拉。“把牛群赶下来！&nbsp;下去，拉玛，&nbsp;下去！”&nbsp;他命令水牛。<br>
            公水牛群站在斜坡边上。阿克拉大叫了一声，它们向前跑去。它们一个接一个地跑下去，就像被洪水冲下去的巨石。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A snarl echoed back. "Who calls me?"<br>
            "It's me—Mowgli!" He turned to Akela. "Bring the herd down now! Down, Rama, down!" he commanded the buffalo.<br>
            The male herd stood at the edge of the slope. Akela gave a hunting yell, and they fell forward. They fell, one after the other, like boulders crashing down during a flood.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在峡谷里，拉玛很快就闻到了谢尔坎的气味。现在，水牛们知道他们的任务是什么了。那就是袭击老虎。<br>
            刚开始，谢尔坎听到了雷鸣般的蹄声。他站起来，左看右看，试图找到一条路逃出峡谷。但峡谷壁笔直，满是弯曲的藤蔓。而且，吃了一顿大餐后，他正觉得犯困，身子发沉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the ravine Rama quickly caught Shere Khan's scent. Now the buffalo knew what their job was—it was a charge against a tiger.<br>
            Shere Khan first heard a thunder of hooves. He picked himself up and looked from side to side, trying to find a way out of the ravine. But its walls were straight and full of twisting vines. And he was still sleepy and heavy from his large meal.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            牛群跑过水沟，溅起水花。动物们大声吼叫。毛克利听到峡谷另一端母水牛们的回应。谢尔坎转身看向那些母水牛。然后，&nbsp;老虎突然转向公水牛。老虎本能地知道，面对他们要比面对任何一头保护小水牛的妈妈都容易。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The stampede splashed through a pool of water. The animals bellowed loudly. Mowgli heard a reply from the females at the other end of the ravine. Shere Khan turned to look toward the females too. Then the tiger whirled back toward the males. The tiger knew by instinct that it was better to face them than any protective mothers.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，拉玛被绊了一下。他身后的野兽们猛烈地撞向靠近的母水牛们。很快，两个水牛群都冲过峡谷，边跑边愤怒地喷着鼻息。<br>
            毛克利从拉玛的背上跳下来。“快，阿克拉！在它们开始打架之前，把它们分开。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then Rama stumbled. The beasts behind him crashed hard into the approaching females. Soon both herds ran, snorting angrily, and rushing into the ravine.<br>
            Mowgli jumped down from Rama's back. "Quick, Akela! Break them up before they start fighting one another."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            阿克拉和格瑞布拉德绕着水牛跑，试图把它们分开。突然，水牛群转向了毛克利。&nbsp;它们准备再次冲进峡谷。<br>
            但毛克利举起手来。谢尔坎已经死了。很快，饥饿的鸟儿就会来找他的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Akela and Gray Brother ran around the buffalo, trying to separate them. Suddenly the herd turned toward Mowgli. They were ready to charge through the ravine again.<br>
            But Mowgli held up his hand. Shere Khan was already dead. Soon hungry birds would be coming for him.

            死老虎躺在毛克利的脚边。“我们必须快点弄。”&nbsp;毛克利对阿克拉和格瑞布拉德说，“我想把老虎的皮放在会议的岩石上。”&nbsp;<br>
            他们开始准备虎皮。突然，狼们飞快地跑开了。毛克利感到一只手紧紧抓住了他的肩膀。布尔迪奥拿着枪站在那里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The dead tiger lay at Mowgli's feet. "We must work fast," Mowgli said to Akela and Gray Brother. "I want to lay the tiger's hide at Council Rock."<br>
            They got to work preparing the hide. Suddenly the wolves dashed off, and Mowgli felt a hand clamp down on his shoulder. Buldeo stood there with his gun.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那只老虎的皮是我的！”&nbsp;猎人大声说道，“悬赏虎皮的钱很多。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利转了一下眼睛。“我相信你打算给我一些奖励。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我是最棒的猎手。”&nbsp;布尔迪奥说，“我不会给你任何奖励。你抓住老虎只是因为运气好。”&nbsp;他走近老虎，俯身仔细地看着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That tiger's hide belongs to me!" the hunter growled. "There's a big reward for it."<br>
            Mowgli rolled his eyes. "I'm sure you're planning to give me some of the reward."<br>
            "I'm the chief hunter," Buldeo said. "I'm not going to give you any of the reward. You caught the tiger only because of dumb luck." He went toward the tiger, and, bending over, looked closely.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这只老虎和我是宿敌。”&nbsp;毛克利说。然后，他挥了挥手。“阿克拉！”&nbsp;<br>
            几秒钟后，布尔迪奥发现自己躺在草地上。一只大灰狼站在他身上。<br>
            布尔迪奥惊讶地眨了眨眼。毛克利召唤了一只狼！<br>
            “这是最坏的巫术！”&nbsp;他想。他吓坏了，像石头一样一动不动地躺着。如果毛克利召唤更多的狼，怎么办？或者他把他自己变成狼或老虎？
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This tiger and I are old enemies," Mowgli said. Then he waved an arm. "Akela!"<br>
            Seconds later Buldeo found himself lying on the grass. A large gray wolf stood over him.<br>
            Buldeo blinked in surprise. Mowgli had summoned a wolf!<br>
            "This is magic of the worst kind!" he thought. Terrified, he lay as still as a stone. What if Mowgli summoned more wolves? Or he turned himself into a wolf or tiger?
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “伟大的国王。”&nbsp;布尔迪奥终于低声说道。<br>
            “嗯？”&nbsp;毛克利笑了。现在，猎人害怕他了。<br>
            “我是个老人。我不知道你这么厉害。我可以起来吗？你的狼会把我撕成碎片吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Great King," Buldeo said at last in a whisper.<br>
            "Yes?" Mowgli grinned. Now the hunter was afraid of him.<br>
            "I'm an old man. I didn't know that you were a powerful sorcerer. May I get up? Will your wolf tear me to pieces?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你走吧。但从现在起，别来烦我。”&nbsp;毛克利回答道。“放他走，阿克拉。”&nbsp;他命令道。<br>
            布尔迪奥一瘸一拐飞快地向村庄走去。每隔几分钟，他就紧张地回头看看。他回到村里时，告诉村民们他看到了什么。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Go. But from now on, leave me alone," Mowgli replied. "Let him go, Akela," he commanded.<br>
            Buldeo limped away to the village as fast as he could. Every few minutes he looked back nervously. When he got to the village, he told the villagers about what he'd seen.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利和狼们完成了准备虎皮的事情。毛克利把它藏在一棵树旁。然后，他聚集起水牛群，把它们都带回了村庄。当他走近时，听见了很大的铃声。好像半个村庄的人都在门口等着他。<br>
            “村民们很高兴我杀了老虎。”&nbsp;毛克利骄傲地自言自语，“他们一定在等着感谢我呢！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli and the others finished preparing the tiger's hide. Mowgli hid it near a tree. Then he gathered the buffalo herd and took them back to the village. As he approached, bells clanged loudly. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate.<br>
            "The villagers are happy that I killed the tiger,” Mowgli said to himself proudly. "They must be waiting to thank me!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，一块块石头从毛克利耳边呼啸而过。愤怒的喊声不停地传来。<br>
            “巫师！”&nbsp;<br>
            “森林恶魔！”&nbsp;<br>
            “开枪打死他，布尔迪奥！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Instead a shower of stones whistled past Mowgli's ears. Angry shouts rose.<br>
            "Sorcerer!"<br>
            "Jungle demon!"<br>
            "Shoot him, Buldeo!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那把旧枪嘡的一声响了起来，但子弹没有打中毛克利，而是打中了一头水牛。<br>
            “那男孩儿又使用巫术了！”&nbsp;一个村民喊道，“他用巫术把子弹转了过去！”&nbsp;村民们向毛克利扔了更多的石头。<br>
            他弯下身子躲闪，努力不惊慌。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The old gun went off with a bang. But the bullet missed Mowgli—striking a buffalo instead.<br>
            "The boy just used magic again!" a villager shouted. "He turned that bullet around with magic!" The villagers threw more stones at Mowgli.<br>
            He ducked, trying not to panic.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            阿克拉和格瑞布拉德跑到他身边。“这就像狼群一样。”&nbsp;阿克拉说，“他们希望你走，毛克利。”&nbsp;<br>
            “上次我被赶走因为我是人。”&nbsp;毛克利叹了口气。“这次因为我是狼！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Akela and Gray Brother ran to his sides. "This is just like the wolf pack," Akela said. "They want you gone, Mowgli."<br>
            "Last time I was told to leave because I'm a human." Mowgli sighed. "This time it is because I am a wolf!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，麦苏雅从人群中跑了出来。“我的儿子！你的巫术故事是真的吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            当更多的石头在他头上呼啸而过时，毛克利弯腰躲开了。“我不是巫师，麦苏雅，你知道的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你必须在他们伤害你之前离开！”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then Messua ran out from the crowd. "My son! Are the stories about your magic true?"<br>
            Mowgli ducked as more stones whizzed by his head. "I'm not a sorcerer, Messua. You know that."<br>
            "You must go away before they hurt you!" she said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有几个人朝空中挥舞着拳头。“离巫师远点儿，麦苏雅！”&nbsp;他们喊道，“回到这儿来，不然我们也会用石头砸你！”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利迅速拥抱了一下麦苏雅，感谢麦苏雅对自己的好意。然后，他和两只狼从人类村庄逃走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A few people pumped their fists in the air. "Get away from the sorcerer, Messua!" they shouted. "Come back here, or we will stone you too!"<br>
            Mowgli quickly hugged Messua. He thanked her for her kindness to him. Then he and the two wolves ran away from the people's village.

            Akela tilted his head to look at Mowgli. "What are you going to do if the humans don't leave you alone?"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            格瑞布拉德低声咆哮着。巴希拉摇了摇尾巴，看了一眼阿克拉。“你为什么这么说？”&nbsp;他问道。<br>
            “昨晚会议后，我沿着小路回家。”&nbsp;阿克拉回答，“我看见了蝙蝠。他告诉我人类的村庄像蜂巢一样嗡嗡响。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Gray Brother growled softly. Bagheera twitched his tail and glanced at Akela. "What made you say that?" he asked.<br>
            "After last night's council, I went home along the trail," Akela answered. "I met the bat. He told me that the humans' village has been humming like a bees' nest."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那又怎样？”&nbsp;毛克利耸了耸肩。“人类总是很忙。”&nbsp;<br>
            “蝙蝠看到村门口盛开的红花。他还看见一些男人坐在红花旁边。他们手里拿着枪。”&nbsp;阿克拉看着毛克利的眼睛。“还有，今天早上在我们的山路上，我闻到了一个人的气味。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So?" Mowgli shrugged. "The humans are often busy."<br>
            "So, the bat saw the red flower blooming at the village gate. He also saw some men sitting near it. They were holding guns." Akela looked Mowgli in the eye. "And I believe I smelled a man along our trail this morning."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他们在追杀你，毛克利。”&nbsp;巴希拉说道。<br>
            “但是，是他们把我从人群中赶走的！”&nbsp;毛克利说，“为什么他们不放过我？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你是人类。”&nbsp;阿克拉轻声回答，“我们是动物。我们不能向你解释你的种族。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They are hunting you, Mowgli," Bagheera said.<br>
            "But they threw me out of their pack!" Mowgli said. "Why can't they just leave me alone?"<br>
            "You're a human, Little Brother," Akela replied softly. "We are animals. We cannot explain your kind to you."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利低下头。他不知道应该说什么。<br>
            “那是什么？”&nbsp;巴希拉跳了起来。他闻了闻空气。他的身体僵硬了。<br>
            格瑞布拉德也闻了闻，他闻了从右边吹来的风。<br>
            “这是人的气味！”&nbsp;巴希拉说道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli looked down. He didn't know what to say.<br>
            "What's that?" Bagheera sprang to his feet. He sniffed the air. His body stiffened.<br>
            Gray Brother did the same thing, sniffing the wind that was blowing from the right.<br>
            "It's a human's scent!" Bagheera said.

            毛克利的嗅觉比大多数人都好，但他没有一个真正的森林鼻子。所以，他花了更长的时间才能找到气味。<br>
            “是布尔迪奥！”&nbsp;他低声说，“他一定在跟踪我的脚印。我能看到他的枪在阳光下闪闪发光。看！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli could smell things better than most humans could. But he did not have a true jungle nose. So it took him longer to find the scent.<br>
            "It's Buldeo!" he whispered. "He must have followed my trail. I can see the sunlight glinting off his gun. Look!"

            一些灌木丛中飞快地闪过一道亮光。但是，他们都看到了。<br>
            四只年轻的狼突然向山坡下跑去。<br>
            “你们要去哪里？”&nbsp;毛克利说。<br>
            “打猎！”&nbsp;格瑞布拉德回答说，“跟我们走！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            There was just a quick flash of light among some shrubs. But they all saw it.<br>
            The four young wolves suddenly ran downhill.<br>
            "Where are you going?" Mowgli said.<br>
            "Hunting!" Gray Brother answered. "Come on with us!"
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不可以。人类不猎杀其他人类！”&nbsp;毛克利在他们后面喊道。<br>
            阿克拉看了他一眼，毛克利躲开了目光。<br>
            “我们就找到这个人，看看他想要做什么吧。”&nbsp;巴希拉说道。<br>
            毛克利向前跑，无声地穿过森林，跟在年轻的狼后面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I can't. Humans do not hunt other humans!" Mowgli called after them.<br>
            Akela gazed at him, and Mowgli looked away.<br>
            "Let's just find this man and see what he wants," Bagheera said.<br>
            Mowgli ran forward, darting noiselessly through the jungle behind the young wolves.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大家跟在后面。果然不出所料，当毛克利拨开一些灌木丛时，他看见了布尔迪奥。布尔迪奥肩上背着枪，沿路走过来。突然，他停了下来，困惑地看着地面。<br>
            阿克拉在毛克利旁边轻轻地笑了。“今天早上，我在山路上加了些脚印，脚印通往不同的方向。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The others followed. Sure enough, when Mowgli pushed aside some bushes, there was Buldeo. His gun on one shoulder, the hunter trotted along the path. Abruptly he halted, looking at the ground in confusion.<br>
            Akela chuckled softly from beside Mowgli. "This morning I added some prints to the trail. They're going in all different directions."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “难怪布尔迪奥糊涂了。”&nbsp;毛克利笑着轻声说。<br>
            最后，猎人叹了一口气，坐下了。他不知道毛克利和动物们就在附近看着他。他愤怒地自言自语。<br>
            “他在说什么？”&nbsp;巴希拉问毛克利。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No wonder Buldeo is confused," Mowgli whispered with a grin.<br>
            Finally the hunter took a breath and sat down. He had no idea that Mowgli and the animals were nearby, watching him. He muttered angrily to himself.<br>
            "What is he saying?" Bagheera asked Mowgli.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他很快翻译出布尔迪奥的话。“他说‘狼群一定在我周围跳舞了。我从没见过这样的山路！’现在，他在抱怨自己又累又饿。”&nbsp;<br>
            布尔迪奥吃了一些坚果。不一会儿，几个男人沿路走了过来。他们也坐下休息。布尔迪奥开始给他们讲一些荒唐的故事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He quickly translated Buldeo's words. "He says, 'packs of wolves must have danced round me. I never saw a trail like this!' Now he's complaining about being tired and hungry."<br>
            Buldeo ate some nuts. Soon some other men wandered along the trail. They sat down for a rest too. Buldeo began telling them some wild stories.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利听的时候，差点笑出声来。布尔迪奥告诉那些人，是他杀死了大老虎谢尔坎。然后，他说一个男孩儿把自己变成了狼。<br>
            “我和他打了一下午。”&nbsp;猎人说，“我觉得他在我的枪上施了巫术。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli nearly laughed aloud as he listened. Buldeo was telling the men that he had killed the great tiger, Shere Khan. Then he said that a boy had turned himself into a wolf.<br>
            "I fought with him all afternoon," the hunter said. "I think he used magic on my gun."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你为什么这么说？”&nbsp;其中一个男人问。<br>
            “一颗对准他的子弹突然旋转，打中了我自己的一头水牛！我是最棒的猎手。所以，我的村庄派我来抓他。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利的朋友们担心地看了他一眼。然而，毛克利仍然咧嘴笑着。“他的故事很荒唐。但是，那些男人相信他！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What makes you say that?" one of the men asked.<br>
            "A bullet meant for him suddenly spun around. It went into one of my own buffalo! I'm the chief hunter. So my village has sent me to hunt him down."<br>
            Mowgli's friends glanced over, worried. However, Mowgli was still grinning. "His stories are ridiculous. But the other men believe him!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “同时，村民们把麦苏雅和她的丈夫关了起来。”&nbsp;布尔迪奥说，“他们也是巫师。事实上，他们是最坏的一类，因为他们在抚养那个狼孩儿。他们将受到惩罚，甚至可能被烧死。”&nbsp;<br>
            男人们大吃一惊。“什么时候？”&nbsp;有人问道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Meanwhile the villagers have locked up Messua and her husband," Buldeo was saying. "They are sorcerers too. In fact, they are the worst kind because they were raising this wolf child. They will be punished—perhaps even burned to death."<br>
            The men gasped. "When?" one asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “在我带着那个男孩儿的尸体回去之前，什么也不会发生的。”&nbsp;布尔迪奥回答道，“对了，我觉得他就在附近。你们见过他吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            巴希拉又看了一眼毛克利。他注意到那个男孩儿的表情变了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Nothing will be done until I return with the boy's dead body," Buldeo replied. "By the way, I have reason to think he's nearby. Have you seen him?"<br>
            Bagheera glanced at Mowgli again. He noticed that the boy's expression had changed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “男人们在说什么？”&nbsp;黑豹低声说。<br>
            毛克利表情沉重地翻译着。他解释说村民们把麦苏雅和她的丈夫关了起来。<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;格瑞布拉德困惑地摇了摇头。“人类互相猎杀？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What are the men saying?" the panther whispered.<br>
            With a grim look, Mowgli translated. He explained the villagers had trapped Messua and her husband.<br>
            "What?" Gray Brother shook his head in confusion. "You're saying humans hunt each other?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “布尔迪奥这么说的。”&nbsp;毛克利皱着眉头。“&nbsp;他的话我不能完全听懂，人类都疯了。但我知道一点：麦苏雅和她丈夫没有做错什么。他们只是给我饭吃，给我地方住而已。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利又听了一些布尔迪奥说的话。他的表情越来越坚定。“我要回到村庄去。我不会让他们杀了麦苏雅！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So Buldeo says." Mowgli scowled. "I cannot understand all his talk—people are crazy. But I do know this: Messua and her husband have done nothing wrong. They just fed me and gave me a place to live."<br>
            Mowgli listened to Buldeo some more. His expression grew more and more determined. "I am going back to the village. I won't let them kill Messua!"

            动物们试图阻止毛克利。但是，他已经向村庄跑去了。黄昏时分，他到了草地。他害怕极了。每个人都很早就从田里回来了。人们没在准备晚饭，而是聚在无花果树下。他们生气地大喊着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The animals tried to stop Mowgli. But he was already racing toward the village. By twilight he reached the grazing grounds. Fear jumped up in his throat. Everyone was in from the fields early. Instead of preparing dinner, people were gathered under the fig tree. They were shouting angrily.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利悄悄地向麦苏雅的小屋走去。他偷偷地透过窗户往里面看，只见麦苏雅的丈夫被绑在床上。麦苏雅躺在地上，嘴被堵着，手脚被绑着。她吃力地喘着气，痛苦地呻吟着。<br>
            毛克利吓了一跳。麦苏雅被打得很严重。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli crept to Messua’s hut. Peeking through a window, he saw Messua's husband tied to the bed. Messua lay on the floor, bound and gagged. She was breathing hard and groaning in pain.<br>
            Mowgli was shocked. Messua had been badly beaten!

    </div>
    <div>

            毛克利很了解村民们的习惯。只要人们能吃饭和聊天，他们就会待在树下。但当布尔迪奥没抓到毛克利回到村庄时，他们就会回来的。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli knew the habits of the villagers well. As long as the people could eat and talk, they would stay under the tree. But they would come when Buldeo returned to the village—without Mowgli.<br>
            He slipped through the window of the hut. Bending over Messua and her husband, he cut their ties.

            "The whole village," Messua's husband answered. "They think we are rich sorcerers who are using magic."<br>

            “Go where?" Messua's eyes were wide and frightened. "We don't know the jungle well. And I'm injured. I can't walk very fast."<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            夫妻俩点了点头。<br>
            “好。别害怕。我保证森林会保护你们。现在走，慢慢走。不用着急。”&nbsp;<br>
            泪水从她的脸颊流下来。麦苏雅拥抱毛克利说再见。然后，他们走进了黑暗的森林。狼妈妈悄悄地跟着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The couple nodded.<br>
            "Good. Don't be afraid. I promise—the jungle will protect you. Go now and travel slowly. There's no need to hurry."<br>
            Tears streaming down her cheeks, Messua hugged Mowgli good-bye. Then they headed into the dark jungle. Mother Wolf silently followed.

            很快，另一个动物出现了。“巴希拉！”&nbsp;毛克利迅速向他解释了情况。“布尔迪奥还在给村民们讲故事。但是，他会停下来的，然后人们就会过来。当人们发现这个小屋空了，我们该怎么办呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “嗯。”&nbsp;巴希拉想了一会儿，“我有一个办法。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon someone else appeared. "Bagheera!" Mowgli quickly explained the situation. "Buldeo is still telling stories to the villagers. However, he will stop talking, and then the people will come. What will we do when the humans find this trap empty?"<br>
            "Hmm." Bagheera thought for a moment. "I have an idea."

            布尔迪奥终于讲完了他的故事。村民们离开了无花果树。他们挥舞着棍子和刀子冲向麦苏雅的小屋。他们都带着火把。<br>
            “我们要烧了巫师的小屋！”&nbsp;人们愤怒地大喊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At last Buldeo finished telling his stories. The villagers left the fig tree. They rushed toward Messua's hut, waving clubs and knives. They all carried torches.<br>
            "Let's burn down the sorcerers' hut!" people yelled angrily.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            人群来到小屋，砸开了门。每个人都以为麦苏雅和她丈夫被困在里面。可是，他们不在，只有一只凶猛的黑豹趴在床上。<br>
            巴希拉慢慢抬起头，尖利的白牙闪闪发光。<br>
            村民们尖叫起来。然后，他们害怕地跑到外面。他们跑回自己的小屋，砰的一声关上了门。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The crowd reached the hut and tore off the door. Everyone thought Messua and her husband would be trapped inside, but they weren't there. There was just a fierce black panther lying on the bed.<br>
            Bagheera slowly raised his head, flashing sharp white teeth.<br>
            The villagers screamed. Then, Scared, they ran outside. They raced to their huts and slammed shut the doors.

            毛克利从阴影中走出来，咧嘴笑着。“这个主意很好，巴希拉！”&nbsp;<br>
            “谢谢。”&nbsp;黑豹自豪地边说边舔着自己的爪子。“天亮前，村民们不会出来的。我们现在休息一下吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            当毛克利第二天醒来时，他看到了兰，那只老鹰。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli stepped out of the shadows and grinned. "That was a good plan, Bagheera!"<br>
            "Thank you," the panther said proudly as he licked his paws. "The villagers won't come out until daylight. Let's get some rest now."<br>
            When Mowgli woke the next day, he saw Rann, the hawk.

            毛克利高兴地挥了挥手。“谢谢！”&nbsp;然后，他去告诉巴希拉。<br>
            巴希拉说：“人们还躲在屋子内。我们为什么不忘掉他们，去打猎呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I have a message from Mother Wolf," the bird called. "Messua and her husband are safe in the new village. It is near a marsh."<br>
            Mowgli waved happily. "Thank you!" Then he went off to tell Bagheera.<br>
            Bagheera spoke: "The people are still hiding inside their homes. Would you like to forget about them and go hunting?"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利摇了摇头。“对不起，巴希拉。我必须完成我已经开始的事情。这是森林法则。那些违反规则的人必须受到惩罚，记得吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            巴希拉耸了耸肩。<br>
            “我在哪里能找到哈提？”&nbsp;毛克利问道。<br>
            “哈提？”&nbsp;巴希拉说，“我不知道。他想去哪儿吃就去哪儿吃。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli shook his head. "I'm sorry, Bagheera. I have to finish what I started. It's the law of the jungle. Those who break rules must be punished, remember?"<br>
            Bagheera shrugged.<br>
            "Where can I find Hathi?" Mowgli asked.<br>
            "Hathi?" Bagheera said. "I don't know. He feeds wherever he wants."

            “拜托了，巴希拉。”&nbsp;突然，毛克利想到了一个办法。“如果哈提不来，你就说这些话：破坏田地。相信我，他会跟着你的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can you find him and bring him to me?"<br>
            Bagheera gave Mowgli a puzzled look. "I can't give orders to the master of the jungle."<br>
            "Please, Bagheera." Then Mowgli had an idea. "If Hathi won't come, say these words: the sacking of the fields. Trust me, that will make him follow you."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “破坏田地？”&nbsp;巴希拉重复着这句话，直到他记住了。然后，他跑开了。<br>
            巴希拉回来时，天已经黑了。毛克利松了一口气。哈提和巴希拉在一起。大象的三个儿子跟在后面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "'The sacking of the fields'?" Bagheera repeated the words until he remembered them. Then off he ran.<br>
            It was dark when Bagheera finally returned. To Mowgli's relief, Hathi was with him. The elephant's three sons trailed after them.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你好，毛克利。”&nbsp;哈提喊道。毛克利向这头老象行了个礼。然后，他转向巴希拉。<br>
            “我想给你讲一个关于一头聪明大象的故事。”&nbsp;毛克利说。<br>
            巴希拉看起来很惊讶，但他对毛克利点了点头。<br>
            “有一次，这头大象被猎人的捕兽器抓住了。”&nbsp;毛克利看了一眼哈提。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello, Mowgli!" Hathi called. Mowgli greeted the old elephant. Then he turned to Bagheera.<br>
            "I'm going to tell you a story about a wise elephant," Mowgli said.<br>
            Bagheera looked startled, but he gave Mowgli a nod.<br>
            "This elephant once got caught in a hunter's trap." Mowgli glanced at Hathi.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在月光下，大家都能看到他侧身上有一道长长的白色疤痕。看起来好像有人用一根滚烫的鞭子打过他。<br>
            “人们赶来要把他从捕兽器上弄出来。”&nbsp;毛克利继续说，“但他很强壮，挣脱了绳子。他离开了，直到伤口痊愈。一天晚上，他带领别的大象回来了。”&nbsp;他看着哈提。“接下来发生了什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the moonlight everyone could see a long white scar on his side. It looked as if someone had hit him with a red-hot whip.<br>
            "Men came to take him from the trap," Mowgli continued. "But he was very strong and broke free of the ropes. He went away until his wound healed. Then one night he came back with some other elephants." He looked at Hathi. "What happened next?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            哈提把故事讲完。“我们踩了人类的田地。我们吃了他们的庄稼。我们把房顶从他们小屋上掀了下来。然后......”&nbsp;他停了一下。“我们让野生森林进来。我们让野生森林重新在村庄里生长起来，吞没了一切。”&nbsp;毛克利满意地点了点头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Hathi finished the story. "We stomped on the men's fields. We ate their crops. We tore the roofs off their huts. And then . . ." He paused. "We let the wild jungle in. It grew back and swallowed up everything." Mowgli nodded, satisfied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大象摇着鼻子看着他。“你怎么知道这些田地被破坏了？”&nbsp;<br>
            “一天晚上，布尔迪奥讲了那个故事。”&nbsp;毛克利说，“我想他偶尔会说实话。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你想从我这里得到什么？”&nbsp;哈提问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The elephant swung his trunk to look at him. "How did you know about the sacking of the fields?"<br>
            "Buldeo told that story one night," Mowgli said. "I guess he tells the truth once in a while."<br>
            "What do you want from me?" Hathi asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “住在这个村庄里的人很残忍。”&nbsp;毛克利解释说，“他们伤害了麦苏雅和她的丈夫。他们打算杀了我。然后，他们要用红花杀死麦苏雅。只有惩罚他们才是对的。”&nbsp;<br>
            巴希拉颤抖着放低了身子。现在他明白毛克利为什么要找哈提了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The people living in this village are cruel," Mowgli explained. "They hurt Messua and her husband. They were planning to kill me. And then they were going to kill Messua with the red flower. It's only right to punish them."<br>
            Bagheera shivered and dropped down low. Now he understood why Mowgli had sent for Hathi.

            第二天，&nbsp;哈提抬起了他的鼻子。“我们走吧！”&nbsp;他大喊。然后，他和他的三个儿子出发了。大象向不同的方向行进。他们到了村民的田地，行进了好几天。他们踩坏了草地、庄稼、工具和他们发现的其他任何东西。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day Hathi lifted his trunk. "Let's go!" he called, and then he and his three sons set out. The elephants marched in different directions. They reached the villagers' fields and marched around for days. They stomped on grass, crops, tools—and anything else they found.

            很快，成群的鹿、猪和豪猪加入了大象的队伍。他们都开始吃剩下的庄稼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At first the other jungle creatures watched the elephants' march from a distance. Then birds flew over the jungle, spreading the news.<br>
            "Food! Food for everyone!"<br>
            Soon herds of deer, pigs, and porcupines joined the elephants. They all began eating what was left of the crops.

            Baloo came and found some tasty roots. "Delicious!"<br>
            Other animals knocked down barley and drank from the tank of water. Birds flew down for seeds and grain. Monkeys scattered as the python Kaa slithered into the valley. He was hungry too.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大象在田地里不停地走来走去。很快，村庄里的人们就饿得绝望了。<br>
            “没有庄稼了。”&nbsp;一个村民说，“我们必须在森林中寻找食物。”&nbsp;<br>
            一群人进入森林寻找坚果。但是，有着明亮眼睛的影子们吓了他们一跳，他们跑了出去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On and on, round and round the fields, the elephants marched. Soon the people in the village grew desperate from hunger.<br>
            "There are no more crops," a villager said. "We must look for food in the jungle."<br>
            A group of people entered the jungle to look for nuts. But, startled by shadows with bright eyes, they ran out.

            雨季来临时，四头大象在田地里完成了他们的任务。他们开始向村民们的小屋走去。<br>

            “他们要把小屋的屋顶掀下来。”&nbsp;毛克利说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            By the time the rainy season came, the four elephants had finished their work in the fields. They began marching toward the villagers' huts. <br>

            "They're going to rip off the huts' roofs," Mowgli said.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Most of the villagers had already left to find new homes. Now it was time for the rest to go.<br>
            A month later Mowgli and Bagheera returned to the village. The place was covered with mounds of grass and thick weeds. Six months later the two of them came back again. Now the jungle had grown back.

            “这正是我想象的，巴希拉。”&nbsp;毛克利小声说。野生森林吞没了人类村庄的所有痕迹。<br>
            大象行进后，毛克利回到了狼洞。他找到一个方法惩罚残忍的村民们&nbsp;。根据森林法则，这个惩罚解决了所有的问题。但是，毛克利既不安又不开心。他不觉得饿，也几乎睡不着觉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's just as I imagined, Bagheera," Mowgli whispered. The wild jungle had swallowed up every trace of the people's village.<br>
            After the elephants' march, Mowgli returned to the wolves' cave. He had found a way to punish the villagers for their cruelty. According to the law of the jungle, this punishment settled things. Yet Mowgli was restless and unhappy. He didn't feel hungry and he rarely slept.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我怎么了？”&nbsp;他很好奇。<br>
            一天，天气很热，毛克利正在河里玩儿水。突然，他渴望逃跑。他穿过森林，从一棵树跳到另一棵树。他跑了一个下午，唱歌、游泳和打猎。最后，他发现自己身处森林中一个陌生的地方。在一个村庄外的沼泽地附近，他听见几只狗在叫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why am I like this?" he wondered.<br>
            One hot day Mowgli was splashing in the river. Suddenly eager to escape, he took off through the jungle, leaping from tree to tree. He ran all afternoon—singing, swimming, and hunting. At last he found himself in a strange part of the jungle. Near a marsh at the outskirts of a village, he heard several dogs barking.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “人类的村庄！”&nbsp;毛克利想。他好奇地向狗叫的声音走去。它们在小屋前走来走去。毛克利像狼一样咆哮，它们立刻不叫了。<br>
            然后，一个女人走到门口。她戴着铜手镯，头发有点灰色。“谁在那儿？”&nbsp;她喊道。她吓得声音颤抖。“是另一只豺狼吗？”&nbsp;她问狗们。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "A human village!" Mowgli thought. Curious, he crept toward the sound of the barking dogs. They were pacing around in front of a hut. Mowgli growled like a wolf, and they instantly stopped barking.<br>
            Then a woman came to the door. She wore copper bracelets, and her hair was slightly gray. "Who's there?" she called. Her voice shook with fear. "Is it another jackal?" she asked the dogs.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当他仔细看着她时，毛克利觉得自己也开始发抖。那个女人看上去有点老了，但他知道她的声音。事实上，他很清楚！<br>
            “麦苏雅？”&nbsp;他大喊。他从自己一直躲着的高草里走了出来。<br>
            那女人吓了一跳，把手放在胸口上。“拿图，是你吗？我的儿子？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As he gazed at her, Mowgli felt himself begin to shake too. The woman looked a bit older, but he knew her voice. In fact, he knew it well!<br>
            "Messua?" he called. He stepped out of the tall grass that had been hiding him.<br>
            The woman was surprised and put a hand on her heart. "Nathoo? Is that you—my son?"

            “巴希拉！”&nbsp;毛克利惊讶地说，“你在这里做什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我跟着你来的。”&nbsp;巴希拉回答道。<br>
            “你又跟着我了？”&nbsp;毛克利笑着摇头。“你总是跟着我。我的狼妈妈和格瑞布拉德也是这样。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bagheera!" Mowgli said in surprise. "What are you doing here?"<br>
            "I followed you," Bagheera replied.<br>
            "Again?" Mowgli laughed and shook his head. "You're always following me. So are Mother Wolf and Gray Brother."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            巴希拉看起来很不安。“你要......你要回森林吗？”&nbsp;他问，“我......我以为你会和那个女人待在一起。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利摇了摇头。“我觉得我不属于人类，巴希拉。那群人赶走了我，记得吗？就像狼群一样。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera looked nervous. "Are you . . . Are you coming back to the jungle?" he asked. "I . . . I thought you might stay here with the woman."<br>
            Mowgli shook his head. "I don't think I belong with people, Bagheera. The man pack threw me out—remember? Just like the wolf pack."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            巴希拉盯着毛克利看了几秒。然后，他抬起他的下巴。“摸摸我的下巴下面。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利乖乖地把他的手指放在巴希拉的下巴下。黑豹的毛覆盖着厚厚的肌肉。然后，毛克利摸了摸没有毛的部分。“这是什么？”&nbsp;他问道。<br>
            “那是项圈的痕迹。”&nbsp;巴希拉说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bagheera studied Mowgli for a second. Then he lifted his chin. "Feel under my jaw."<br>
            Mowgli obediently put his fingers under Bagheera's chin. The panther's fur covered thick muscles. Then Mowgli touched a bare patch. "What's this?" he asked.<br>
            "It is the mark of a collar," Bagheera said.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “森林里没有人知道这件事。我也出生在人类中间，毛克利。我住在王宫的一个笼子里。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;毛克利惊讶地眨了眨眼。巴希拉也和人类一起生活过？<br>
            “这就是为什么你小时候我在岩石会议上为你说了话。”&nbsp;巴希拉继续说道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No one in the jungle knows this—I was also born among people, Mowgli. I lived in a cage at the king's palace."<br>
            "What?" Mowgli blinked in surprise. Bagheera had lived with humans too?<br>
            "That's why I spoke for you at Council Rock when you were a little cub," Bagheera went on.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我母亲死在王宫的笼子里。在那之后，我在那里没有家人，而且......”&nbsp;<br>
            毛克利无法想象美丽、强壮的黑豹被关在笼子里。“笼子一定感觉像监狱。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那是个监狱。”&nbsp;巴希拉说。“我住在那里，从来没见过森林。后来，有一天晚上，非常神奇，我发现了自己的力量。我告诉自己我是一只黑豹，不是人们的玩物。我一爪子就把那个锁头打碎了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My mother died in the cages at the palace. After that, I had no family there, and . . ."<br>
            Mowgli couldn't imagine the beautiful, strong black panther trapped in a cage. "The cage must have felt like prison."<br>
            "It was a prison," Bagheera said. "I lived there without ever seeing the jungle. Then one night I mysteriously found my strength. I told myself I was a panther—not a plaything for people. I broke the lock with one blow of my paw."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛克利笑了。那才是巴希拉。<br>
            “现在，你知道我的秘密了，小兄弟。我回到了森林，我属于那里。你也一样......”&nbsp;巴希拉停了一下。“你是一个人类。所以总有一天，你会回到属于你的地方。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mowgli grinned. That was Bagheera.<br>
            "Now you know my secret, Little Brother. I returned to the jungle where I belonged. As for you . . ." Bagheera paused. "You are a human. So one day you too will return to where you belong."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不，对不起，巴希拉，但你错了。”&nbsp;毛克利坚定地摇了摇头。“我永远不会再和人类住在一起的。我去看了麦苏雅。但仅此而已。”&nbsp;他拍了拍黑豹。“还有，等我长大独立了，我会回来看你和巴鲁。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Nope. Sorry, Bagheera, but you're wrong." Mowgli shook his head firmly. "I won't ever live with people again. I'll visit Messua, but that's about it." He patted the panther. "And when I'm older and on my own, I'll come back to visit you and Baloo—"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，一个穿着白色连衣裙的女孩儿出现在路上。毛克利和巴希拉躲到灌木丛后面。当女孩儿经过的时候，毛克利用手拨开灌木丛。他看着那个女孩儿向沼泽地走去。<br>
            “这个男孩儿既是人又是狼。”&nbsp;巴希拉边想边温柔地看着他。“但总有一天，他会变得更像人，而不是狼。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then a girl in a flowing white dress appeared on the path. Mowgli and Bagheera ducked behind some bushes. As the girl passed, Mowgli moved the bushes with his hand. He watched the girl walk toward the marsh.<br>
            "The boy is both man and wolf," Bagheera thought, watching him tenderly. "But one day he will become more man than wolf."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那个女孩儿不见了，巴希拉用鼻子碰了一下毛克利。“你准备好回家了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “嗯。”&nbsp;毛克利跳到黑豹背上。然后，他们一起向森林深处跑去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The girl disappeared, and Bagheera nudged Mowgli with his nose. "Ready to go home, Little Brother?"<br>
            "Yes." Mowgli leaped onto the black panther's back. Then together they went back into the jungle.
