        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            意大利阿博拉的一个小村庄里住着一个老木匠。他的名字叫杰佩托。他一个人住在一个小屋子里。他没有妻子，也没有孩子。每到夜晚降临，他就会觉得非常寂寞。每天早上，他去森林里搜集雕刻用的木材。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the small village of Arbora, Italy, there lived an old carpenter. His name was Geppetto. He lived alone in his small house. He had no wife and no children. When it was very late at night, he was often lonely. Every morning, Geppetto went into the forest to collect wood for carving.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这个树枝和桌腿一样重。但是太短了，我不太满意。”&nbsp;他说。“这个木材像大碗一样宽，但是不够深，我不太满意。这倒是一块好木材。但是太小了，我什么都做不了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “This branch is heavy like a table leg. But it is too short. I don’t like it,” he said. “This log is wide like a bowl, but it is not deep enough. I don’t like it. This is a good piece of wood. But it is too small. I can’t make anything out of this.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            杰佩托把木头扔到了地上。<br>
            “哎呦！”&nbsp;一个声音说。<br>
            “什么？是谁在说话？有人吗？”&nbsp;杰佩托问。他非常困惑。他转过身，往森林的深处看，但是谁也没看到。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Geppetto threw the wood on the ground.<br>
            “Ouch!” said a voice. <br>
            “What? Who said that? Is someone there?” Geppetto asked the forest. He was very confused. He turned around and looked deep into the forest, but saw no one.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “一定是我的幻觉。”&nbsp;他说。于是，他继续往前走。<br>
            “喂！不要把我留在这里！我并不小！我是一块儿好木头。我是可以被充分利用起来的！”&nbsp;那个声音又说。<br>
            杰佩托往回看，他吓呆了。那块木头会说话！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I must be imagining things,” he said, and he kept walking. <br>
            “Hey, don’t leave me here! I’m not too small! I am good wood. You can make something out of me!” the voice said again. <br>
            Geppetto looked back and was very surprised. It was a talking piece of wood!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我一定是疯了！”&nbsp;杰佩托大叫。<br>
            “没错，你是疯了！你把一块儿上好的木头丢在森林里。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不对，我觉得自己疯了，因为我在跟一块木头说话！”&nbsp;<br>
            “喂，我可是一块儿非常聪明的木头呢。”&nbsp;木头反驳道。<br>
            “对，但是你只是一块木头！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I must be crazy!” Geppetto cried. <br>
            “That’s right, you are crazy! You left a fine piece of wood in the forest.” <br>
            “No, I must be crazy because I am talking to a piece of wood!” <br>
            “Hey, I am made of very smart pine,” the wood said, offended. <br>
            “Yes, but you are only a piece of wood!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “只是一块儿木头？先生，把我带回家吧。我会让你知道，我不仅仅是一块儿木头而已。”&nbsp;<br>
            杰佩托很担心自己疯了。但是，他也很寂寞。“这个会说话的木头说不定会知道许多有趣的故事和笑话。”&nbsp;他对自己说。最后，他决定把这块木头带回家。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Only a piece of wood? Take me home, sir, and I will show you I am not only a piece of wood.” <br>
            Geppetto was worried that he was crazy. But, he was also lonely. “This talking piece of wood might know interesting stories or funny jokes,” he said to himself. He decided to take the wood home.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，我该用你做什么呢？我可以把你雕刻成一根擀面杖，或者把你雕刻成一个鸟舍。”&nbsp;杰佩托说。<br>
            “什么？我可不想被雕刻。听上去太疼了！”&nbsp;木头说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Hmm, what should I do with you? I could carve you into a rolling pin for dough. Or I could carve you into a small birdhouse,” Geppetto said. <br>
            “What? I don’t want to be carved. That sounds painful!” said the piece of wood.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那么如果我不把你雕刻成东西，你永远只能是一块木头。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好吧。你可以把我雕刻成东西。但是，请你一定要把我做成有趣的东西。”&nbsp;木头说，“我不想做擀面杖。我也不喜欢鸟。我想看看世界，到处去冒险。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Well, if I don’t carve you into something, you will only be a piece of wood.”   <br>
            “Fine, you can carve me into something. But please, make it something interesting,” said the wood, hopefully. “I don’t want to be a rolling pin. And I don’t like birds. I want to see the world and go on adventures.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那做成烟斗怎么样？富有的旅行家可以带着你。”&nbsp;杰佩托提出他的建议。<br>
            “不要，我不喜欢烟。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那我可以把你雕刻成象棋子。这样每天都是游戏！”&nbsp;杰佩托说。他对自己的想法非常满意。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “How about a pipe? A rich traveler could take you with him,” offered Geppetto.<br>
            “No, I don’t like smoke.” <br>
            “I could carve you into chess pieces. Every day would be a game!” said Geppetto, proud of this idea.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不，你根本就不明白。我想跑。我想走。我想说话。一个小男孩儿怎么样？你可以把我做成一个小男孩儿吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “小男孩儿？嗯……”&nbsp;杰佩托摸着鼻子想。<br>
            “求求你了！我答应你，我一定做一个好男孩。”&nbsp;木头说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “No, you don’t understand. I want to run. I want to walk. I want to talk. How about a boy? Can you make me into a boy?” <br>
            “A boy? Hmm . . .” Geppetto touched his nose, thinking. <br>
            “Yes, please! I promise to be a good boy too,” the wood said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “如果你把我雕刻成一个小男孩儿，我就是你的儿子。我们可以开开心心地住在一起！”&nbsp;木头补充说。<br>
            其实木头根本就不想和杰佩托一起住。它只想环游世界，到处冒险。木头这么说，只是希望杰佩托能够答应它。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “If you carve me into a boy, that means I will be your son. We can live together and have fun!” it added. <br>
            The piece of wood didn’t really want to live with Geppetto. It wanted to travel the world and go on adventures. But, the wood said this hoping Geppetto would agree.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “小男孩儿。好，我觉得这是个好主意。我们马上开始吧！”&nbsp;杰佩托露出了开心的笑容。<br>
            他为自己将有一个儿子感到高兴。他为自己不再寂寞感到高兴。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “A boy. Yes, I think that is a good idea. Let’s get started right away!” said Geppetto, as he smiled a very big smile. <br>
            He was happy to have a son. He was happy he was not alone.
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            杰佩托小心地带着会说话的木头回到了家。杰佩托的家干净整洁。在一个大房间里，有一张床，一张桌子，一些工具和一个火炉。虽然杰佩托努力工作，但他并没有太多钱。然而，杰佩托并不在乎。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Geppetto carried his talking wood home carefully. Geppetto’s home was simple and clean. He had one large room with a bed, a table, his tools, and a stove. Although Geppetto worked hard, he did not have very much money. But he didn’t mind.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在我该从哪里开始呢？”&nbsp;他自言自语地说。“我可从来没有做过小男孩儿呢。”&nbsp;<br>
            “从腿开始吧！这样我就可以跑得很快了！”&nbsp;木头说。<br>
            “不，我觉得你应该先有眼睛，这样你才不会撞到墙。我不希望你受伤。”&nbsp;杰佩托说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Now, where should I start?” he wondered aloud. “I’ve never made a boy before.”<br>
            “Start with the legs! That way I can run fast!” said the wood. <br>
            “No, I think you had better have eyes first, so you don’t run into walls. I don’t want you to get hurt,” Geppetto said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            杰佩托可以做自己的孩子，他感到非常开心。他先雕刻出脸，接着雕刻出眼睛。当脸逐渐成形，杰佩托开始兴奋地想象自己可以和小男孩儿一起做的事。他们在一起会多么地开心呀！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He was happy to be making his very own boy. He started first by carving out the face, and then he carved the eyes. As the wood looked more like a boy’s face, he became excited about what he and his boy could do together. What fun they would have!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好了，你的眼睛看上去很灵活。你看得清楚吗？”&nbsp;杰佩托问。<br>
            “天啊，太糟糕了！”&nbsp;木头大叫。<br>
            “怎么了？”&nbsp;杰佩托担心地说。他以为木头什么也看不见。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “There, your eyes look very smart. How well can you see?” Geppetto asked. <br>
            “Oh, it’s terrible!” cried the wood. <br>
            “What’s wrong?” asked Geppetto, worried. He thought maybe the wood was blind.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们太穷了！看看这个小房间！我想要变富，不是穷。”&nbsp;木头说。听到小男孩儿为他的家感到羞愧，杰佩托觉得非常伤心。他下定决心，小男孩儿需要的，他一定全都给。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “We are very poor! Look at this small room! I want to be rich, not poor,” the wood said. Geppetto was sad that his boy was ashamed of his home. He promised himself that his boy would have whatever he needed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我接下来会雕刻出你的耳朵，这样你就可以听和学习。”&nbsp;杰佩托说。<br>
            杰佩托专心地工作了一整天。他在午饭前雕刻了头发，鼻子和笑脸。然后，他和小男孩儿一起分着吃了第一顿饭，他们吃了面包和奶酪。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I will carve out your ears next, so that you can hear and learn,” Geppetto said.<br>
            Geppetto worked carefully on the wood all through the day. He carved hair, a nose, and a smile before lunch. Then, he shared his first meal of bread and cheese with his boy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “小男孩儿，我们在一起一定会非常开心。”&nbsp;杰佩托边吃边说。他撕下一点面包，放进小男孩儿的嘴里。“只是我不应该叫你‘小男孩儿’。你应该有个名字。我应该叫你什么呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You and I will have great fun together, boy,” said Geppetto as he ate his meal. He tore off some bread and put it into the boy’s mouth. “Only I shouldn’t call you 'boy'. You need a name. What should we name you?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道了！你可以叫我大森林里的王子艾德蒙。”&nbsp;木头说。他喜欢这个名字，因为听上去很大很重要。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I know! My name can be Prince Edmund of the Great Woods,” said the wood. He liked the name because it sounded big and important.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对一个小男孩儿来说，这个名字太大了。你是木头做成的，我叫你匹诺曹，怎么样？”&nbsp;杰佩托说。他想要起一个小男孩儿会喜欢的名字。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “That is too big a name for such a small boy. Since you are made of pinewood, I will call you Pinocchio. What do you think?” asked Geppetto. He wanted to pick a name the boy would like.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好的。匹诺曹，听上去像是一个很重要的名字。虽然没有大森林里的王子艾德蒙那么好，但是我觉得还不错。”&nbsp;他答应了。<br>
            “太好了！那就定匹诺曹了！为了庆祝，我来雕刻你的手臂和双腿，这样我们就能跳舞了！”&nbsp;杰佩托快速地雕刻着木头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Yes—Pinocchio. That sounds important, though it doesn’t sound as grand as Prince Edmund of the Great Woods. I think it will be fine,” he agreed. <br>
            “Wonderful! Pinocchio it is! To celebrate, I will carve your arms and legs so we can dance!” And Geppetto carved quickly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            杰佩托一完成匹诺曹的腿，匹诺曹就跳到地上，从前门跑了出去。<br>
            “等等！”&nbsp;杰佩托喊道，“匹诺曹，你要去哪里？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我要去探险！”&nbsp;匹诺曹大声回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As soon as Geppetto finished carving Pinocchio’s feet, Pinocchio jumped to the floor and ran out of the front door. <br>
            “Wait!” Geppetto called out. “Pinocchio, where are you going?” <br>
            “I am off to find adventures!” Pinocchio called.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但是你还没有衣服呢！没穿衣服怎么可以跑走呢！不要走！”&nbsp;杰佩托一边追着匹诺曹，一边大声喊着。但是，杰佩托忘记把他的刀放在桌子上了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “But, you don’t have any clothes on yet! You can’t run away if you are naked! Please, don’t leave!” Geppetto cried, as he ran after Pinocchio. Unfortunately, Geppetto forgot to leave his knife on the table.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他手拿着刀，追赶着匹诺曹。邻居们以为杰佩托要伤害匹诺曹，就喊了警察：“警察！警察！快抓住他！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He was running after Pinocchio with his knife still in his hand! The neighbors thought he wanted to hurt Pinocchio, so they called for the police: “Police, police! Catch him!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一个警察就在附近，他跑到街上，刚好抓住了杰佩托。他不给杰佩托解释的机会。警察很怕杰佩托的刀，当天晚上他就把杰佩托关进了监狱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One of the policemen was nearby, and he ran into the street just in time to catch Geppetto. He would not let Geppetto explain about Pinocchio. The policeman was scared of Geppetto’s knife, so he threw him in jail for the night.

            可怜的杰佩托被关进了监狱里。但此时匹诺曹正笑着穿过森林。匹诺曹没有穿衣服，但是他一点儿都不在乎。<br>
            “我自由了，我自由了。”&nbsp;他一边跑一边喊，&nbsp;“我可以跑，可以跳，还可以玩儿！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Poor Geppetto was locked in prison. But Pinocchio was laughing and running through the forest. Pinocchio wasn’t wearing clothes, and he didn’t care. <br>
            “I’m free, I’m free,” he shouted as he ran. “I can run and leap and play!”

            太阳开始落山了，匹诺曹开始觉得累了。于是他回到杰佩托的家里。<br>
            “我饿了。”&nbsp;他说。他找遍了家里所有的食物。但是匹诺曹不知道怎么做饭，所以他没办法吃晚餐。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The sun began to set, and Pinocchio was getting tired. So he returned to Geppetto’s house. <br>
            “I’m hungry,” he said, and he searched the house for food. But Pinocchio didn’t know how to cook, so he couldn’t eat.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我好冷。”&nbsp;他说，他找遍了家里所有的衣服。但是在杰佩托给他做衣服之前，他逃跑了。他只好把自己裹在毯子里。<br>
            “我累了。”&nbsp;他说。但是杰佩托的床太高了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I’m cold,” he said, and he searched the house for clothes. But Pinocchio had run away before Geppetto could make him any clothes. So he wrapped himself in a blanket.<br>
            “I’m tired,” he said, but Geppetto’s bed was too tall.

            “哇！”&nbsp;匹诺曹哭道，&nbsp;“我又冷又饿又累，还没有人照顾我！”&nbsp;大大的泪珠顺着他的木头脸庞滑落。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Whaaa!” Pinocchio cried. “I am cold and hungry and tired, and there is no one here to take care of me!” Big tears ran down his wooden face. <br>

            “谁在那儿？”&nbsp;匹诺曹害怕地问。<br>
            夜幕降临，房间里面越来越黑了。匹诺曹看不到任何人。<br>
            “是我。”&nbsp;那个声音再次传来，并伴随着蟋蟀的叫声。<br>
            餐桌上的小蜡烛突然亮了起来。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Who’s there?” asked Pinocchio, a little scared. <br>
            Night was falling and the room was getting dark. Pinocchio couldn’t see anyone. <br>
            “I am,” said the voice again, with a chirping sound. <br>
            A small candle on the table suddenly lit up.

            “我是蟋蟀米克。你可以叫我蟋蟀先生。我住在这个房间里已经有一百年了。但我从来没有见过像你这样的坏孩子！”&nbsp;他责骂道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio saw a cricket crawling down the candle. <br>
            “Oh! You’re a bug!” said Pinocchio. “Who are you?” <br>
            “My name is Mick the Cricket. You may call me Mr. Cricket. I have lived in this room for one hundred years. But I have never seen such a bad boy as you!” he scolded.

            “我也不喜欢你！”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。他对蟋蟀先生感到很生气。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I don’t like you either!” said Pinocchio. He was mad at the cricket for calling him a bad boy. <br>
            “Shame on you for being rude!” chirped the cricket. “I am trying to help you, and Geppetto has been very kind. Is this how you thank your friends?

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            如果是这样，你不会有什么好朋友的。孩子们应该孝敬父母，但是你没有！”&nbsp;<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            If so, you will have very bad friends. Children should honor their parents, and you have not!” <br>
            Pinocchio banged his hand on the table. He was trying to squash Mr. Cricket!

            蟋蟀先生跳到地板上，想要逃跑。但是匹诺曹追着他，想要踩扁他。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I’ll show you! I can have all the friends I want!” Pinocchio screamed. “I can do whatever I want! I don’t have to honor anyone! I am going to go on adventures. One day, I will be rich and famous!”<br>
            Mr. Cricket jumped to the floor to run away. But Pinocchio chased him and tried to step on him.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You are making very bad choices!” said the cricket. “One day those bad choices will hurt you. You can’t run away from the choices you’ve made. You must learn to do honest work and study to be a good boy,” he chirped, and he ran toward the door.

            第二天早上，警察把杰佩托送回家。这时，匹诺曹正在家里哭。他又累又饿，还没有衣服穿。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, the police let Geppetto go back to his house. Meanwhile, Pinocchio was at home crying because he was tired and hungry and had no clothes.

            当杰佩托回到家时，他很生气。<br>

            “是的，爸爸。对不起。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When Geppetto came home, he was very angry with Pinocchio for running away.<br>
            “You are a bad boy, Pinocchio. You must honor me and obey me,” Geppetto said.<br>
            “Yes, Father. I am sorry,” said Pinocchio.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天早上，他决定尝试做个好孩子。做坏孩子并没有什么意思。他知道，如果他向杰佩托道歉，他就会得到食物。<br>
            “我昨晚真的很想你，爸爸。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。不过这次是真的。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Earlier that morning, he had decided to try to be a good boy. Being a bad boy was not much fun. He also knew Geppetto would feed him if he was sorry. <br>
            “I missed you last night, Father,” Pinocchio said. It was true, too.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他希望杰佩托可以一直在这里给他食物，让他开心。相反，他昨天又冷又饿，蟋蟀先生还把他弄哭了。<br>
            杰佩托听到自己的儿子说想念他，心里非常高兴。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He had wished Geppetto had been there to feed him and make him happy. Instead, he had been cold and hungry. And that cricket had made him cry. <br>
            Geppetto’s heart was happy when he heard his son had missed him.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他并不想生匹诺曹的气。&nbsp;“可怜的孩子。”&nbsp;他说，&nbsp;“你看起来很累。你一定又饿又冷。我们吃早餐吧。然后，我给你做衣服穿。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He did not want to be angry with Pinocchio. “Poor boy,” he said. “You look tired. You must be hungry with no food, and cold with no clothes. Let’s eat breakfast, and then, we’ll make you something to wear.”

            杰佩托从口袋里面拿出三个梨。他是在回家的路上摘的。不过，在他还没来得及细细品尝时，匹诺曹已经把三个梨都吃掉了！<br>
            “哦！我还是很饿！”&nbsp;匹诺曹抱怨道。<br>
            “好吧，你不应该浪费食物。把核也啃干净。”&nbsp;杰佩托说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Geppetto pulled three pears from his pocket. He had picked them on the way home. But, before he could take a bite, Pinocchio ate all three! <br>
            “Oh! I am still hungry!” Pinocchio complained. <br>
            “Well, you shouldn’t waste food. Finish the cores,” Geppetto said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹吃掉了核。<br>
            “你说得对，爸爸。我觉得饱多了。你早餐吃了什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的微笑。”&nbsp;杰佩托回答。<br>
            匹诺曹这才意识到他把杰佩托的早餐都吃掉了！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio ate the cores. <br>
            “You’re right, Father. That is much better. What did you eat for breakfast today?” <br>
            “Your smile,” Geppetto replied. <br>
            Pinocchio realized he had eaten all of Geppetto’s food!

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，爸爸！对不起，我吃了你的早餐，而我居然不知道。我真的很自私。我会为你做任何事情。如果你想要我去上学，我也可以。”&nbsp;<br>
            “真的吗？”&nbsp;杰佩托问。儿子终于开始转变了，杰佩托感到很欣慰。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, Father! I’m sorry for eating your food. I didn’t think! How selfish of me. I promise to do anything you ask. I’ll even go to school, if you want.” <br>
            “Really?” asked Geppetto. He was happy his boy was learning some manners.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的，但首先我需要买教科书。我可以要一些钱吗？”&nbsp;匹诺曹问。<br>
            “哦，我没有什么钱。”&nbsp;杰佩托伤心地说，&nbsp;“不过别担心。我一定会帮你拿到书的。”&nbsp;他穿上外套，离开了家。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Yes, but first I need to buy a schoolbook. May I have some money?” Pinocchio asked. <br>
            “Oh, I don’t have any money,” Geppetto said sadly. “But don’t worry. I’ll make sure you get a book.” And he put on his coat and left the house.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他很快就回来了。杰佩托给了匹诺曹他的第一本书。匹诺曹从杰佩托那里接过书，发现杰佩托的外套不见了。<br>
            “谢谢。但是爸爸，你的外套去哪里了？”&nbsp;匹诺曹问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He returned a short time later and gave Pinocchio his first book. Pinocchio took the book from Geppetto and noticed he was no longer wearing his coat. <br>
            “Thank you for the book. But, Father, where is your coat?” Pinocchio asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，我不需要外套。这几天太热了。”&nbsp;杰佩托低着头回答道。杰佩托为了给匹诺曹买书，卖掉了自己的大衣！<br>
            匹诺曹流下了幸福的泪水。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, I don’t need a coat. I’m too warm these days,” Geppetto answered, looking down at the floor. Geppetto had sold his coat to buy Pinocchio a book! <br>
            Pinocchio cried tears of happiness.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢你，爸爸！”&nbsp;他说。他给了杰佩托一个大大的拥抱。<br>

            这一天，他们一直在给匹诺曹做衣服。<br>

            “Oh, thank you, Father!” he said. He gave Geppetto a big hug. <br>

            They worked the rest of the day to make Pinocchio’s clothes. Tomorrow was his first day of school.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio was so happy he couldn’t sleep! Tomorrow was his first day of school. He thought about the wonderful things he would learn. When the sun came up, he jumped out of bed, grabbed his new book, and ran off to school.

            I will be smart enough to get a job and earn money. I will buy Father a new coat. It will be a beautiful coat of green silk with diamond buttons. He was very kind to sell his coat for this book.” <br>

            木偶师傅为了成功地偷走匹诺曹，很快地收拾好自己的马车，准备离开小镇。因为他着急离开，所以他把他的钱袋子、工具和帐篷都堆到了关匹诺曹的笼子上面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The marionette master packed his wagon quickly so he could steal Pinocchio and leave town. Because he was in a hurry, he threw his money bag, tools, and tent in a pile on top of Pinocchio’s cage.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            随着马车移动，最重的袋子掉到了匹诺曹的身边。现在匹诺曹已经不哭了，但他还是很伤心。他能感觉到马车的颠簸和晃动，但是他只能看到麻袋。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As the wagon drove on, the heaviest bags fell next to Pinocchio. By now Pinocchio had stopped crying, though he was still very sad. He felt the wagon bump and jerk, but could only see bags.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，这些袋子里面装的是什么呢？”&nbsp;他想。&nbsp;“那里面一定有什么东西可以帮助我逃跑。”&nbsp;他把手臂尽量地伸出笼子，然后悄悄地打开了第一个袋子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Hmm, I wonder what’s in these bags?” he thought. “There must be something here that will help me escape.” <br>
            He stretched his arm out of the cage as far as it would go and opened the first bag quietly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他把手伸进袋子里面。&nbsp;“哦！这个袋子里面装的都是硬币呀！最少也有一百里拉。”&nbsp;他把一些硬币抓到笼子里。令他惊讶的是，那并不是硬币——而是纯金！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He reached his hand into the bag. “Oh! This bag is full of coins! There must be a hundred lire in here!” He pulled some of the coins into his cage. Much to his surprise, the coins weren’t lire—they were pure gold!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要发财啦！现在，我可以给杰佩托买一件大衣了！但是这些硬币不会帮我逃脱这个笼子。我必须继续寻找。”&nbsp;他小心地悄悄地行动着。他把手伸进了第二个袋子里。“嗯。这个袋子里面有很多不同的东西。我不知道都有什么。让我把它们一个一个都拿出来看看吧。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I’ll be rich! Now I can buy Geppetto a coat! Oh, but these coins won’t help me get out of this cage. I must keep looking.” He was careful to move quietly. He reached into the second bag. “Hmm. This bag has too many different kinds of objects. I can’t tell what any of these are. Let me pull them out one by one.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一个哨子？不，这个没有用。一个汤匙？不，这个没有用。一本书？不，这个也没有用。一些火柴？嗯。我有办法啦。”&nbsp;匹诺曹等着马车停下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A whistle? No, that won’t help. A spoon? No, that won’t help. A book? No, that won’t help. Some matches? Hmm. I have an idea.” Pinocchio waited for the wagon to stop.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，他拿起书，把它包在他的腿上，并点燃了书。然后，他把火柴扔进了马车。&nbsp;“救命！”&nbsp;他喊道。&nbsp;“着火了！我着火了！”&nbsp;木偶师傅听到了匹诺曹的呼救声，也闻到了烧焦的味道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Quickly, he took the book, wrapped it around his leg, and lit the book on fire. Then, he threw the match into the wagon. “Help!” he shouted. “Fire! I’m on fire!” <br>
            The marionette master heard Pinocchio cry for help, and he could smell something burning.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他跑到马车的后面，快速地卸下行李。他试图找到火源。当他到达匹诺曹的笼子时，他抓住笼子，并打开了笼子上面的锁，把匹诺曹从里面拉了出来。他找了一块毯子盖在了匹诺曹的腿上，想要将火扑灭。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He ran to the back of the wagon and began to unpack quickly, trying to find the fire. When he reached Pinocchio’s cage, he grabbed the cage, unlocked it, pulled Pinocchio out, and covered his leg with a blanket so the fire would stop.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你看，那边还在烧着！”&nbsp;匹诺曹指了指马车。“哦，不好了！我的帐篷着火了！”&nbsp;男人大叫着，赶着去把火扑灭。就在木偶师傅试图挽救他的帐篷时，匹诺曹悄悄从毯子里爬出来，跑进了附近的树林里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Look, there’s more fire!” Pinocchio pointed to the wagon. <br>
            “Oh no! My tent is on fire!” the man screamed, and he hurried to put the fire out. While the marionette master was trying to save his tent, Pinocchio snuck out from under the blanket and ran into the nearby woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当大火被扑灭时，匹诺曹早已不见踪影。但他依然可以听到那个人在远处大喊大叫。“不！等一下！匹诺曹，快回来！我会让你成为明星的！”&nbsp;<br>
            匹诺曹跑啊跑啊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            By the time the fire was put out, Pinocchio was long gone, but he could hear the man yelling in the distance, “No! Wait! Pinocchio, please come back! I will make you a star!” <br>
            Pinocchio ran and ran and ran.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但无论多努力地跑，他都没有跑到一个熟悉的地方。匹诺曹停了下来，坐在了一个树桩上。&nbsp;“我迷路了！”&nbsp;他喊道，&nbsp;“我找不到村子，我不知道该怎么办。有人来救我吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But no matter how hard he ran, nothing looked familiar. Pinocchio stopped running and sat down on a stump to think. <br>
            “I’m lost!” he cried. “I can’t find the village and I don’t know what to do. Oh, someone, please help me!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹不知道的是，森林中有许多动物。有些诚实善良，但有些却贪婪无比。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            What Pinocchio didn’t realize is that there are many creatures in the woods. Some are honest and good, and others are greedy.

            匹诺曹迷路了。似乎没有人听到他的呼救声。就在他快要失去希望的时候，他听到了脚步声。“下午好，匹诺曹。”&nbsp;一只狐狸走了过来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio was lost. It seemed that no one had heard him cry for help. But just when he was about to lose hope, he heard footsteps.<br>
            “Good afternoon, Pinocchio,” said a fox as it walked up to him.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            狐狸拄着拐杖。他的身边站着一只用绷带缠着眼睛的猫。<br>
            “你是谁？”&nbsp;匹诺曹说，&nbsp;“你怎么知道我的名字？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The fox was leaning on a cane. To his side was a blind cat with bandages over his eyes. <br>
            "Who are you?” Pinocchio said,  "how do you know my name? ”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们看到你的父亲杰佩托在村子里面到处找你。他请求全体村民帮助他，但是没有人知道在哪里可以找到你。”&nbsp;猫说。<br>
            “可怜的爸爸。他在这么寒冷的天气里找我。他一定很担心。我必须赶快回家，告诉他现在我们是有钱人了。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “We have seen your father, Geppetto, calling for you in the village. He has asked all of the villagers for help, but no one knows where to find you,” said the cat. <br>
            “Poor father, searching for me in the cold. He must be worried. I must hurry home to show him we are rich,” Pinocchio said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一听这话，猫从绷带下偷偷地看了一眼，狐狸挺起背站得笔直。但是，匹诺曹没有注意到。&nbsp;“什么？有钱？”&nbsp;狐狸问，&nbsp;“一个小木头人怎么会有钱呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When they heard this, the cat peeked out from under the bandage and the fox stood straighter. But, Pinocchio did not notice. <br>
            “What? Rich?” asked the fox. “How could a small wooden boy be rich?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我……呃……我赚来的。”&nbsp;匹诺曹撒了谎。<br>
            “赚的吗？怎么赚的钱？”&nbsp;猫问道。<br>
            “我曾经为一位木偶师傅跳舞，是他付给我的钱。”&nbsp;匹诺曹再次撒谎道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I . . . uh . . . I earned the money,” Pinocchio lied. <br>
            “Earned it? How?” asked the cat.<br>
            “I worked as a dancer for the marionette master, and he paid me,” Pinocchio lied again.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不相信像你这样的一个小男孩儿可以有很多钱。你必须给我看看我才能相信你。”&nbsp;猫说。<br>
            “但是，你看不到它。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说，&nbsp;“我已经把它们藏起来了。”&nbsp;他并没有觉得一只瞎眼的猫要求看他的金子是一件多么奇怪的事情。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I don’t believe such a small boy like you could have a lot of money. I would have to see it to believe such a thing,” said the cat.<br>
            “Well, you can’t see it,” said Pinocchio. “I have hidden it away.” <br>
            He didn’t think about how strange it was for a blind cat to ask to see his gold.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你只能带这么点钱给你爸爸，真是可惜。”&nbsp;狐狸说，&nbsp;“他是多么善良的一个人啊。我知道有一个办法可以把很少的钱变成很多的钱。但是我想你肯定不会感兴趣的。来吧，猫先生，我们告诉匹诺曹回家的路就好了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “It’s a shame you can’t take home more than a pocketful of money to Geppetto,” said the fox. “He is such a kind man. I know of a way to make a small bit of money into a large load of money, but I’m sure you wouldn’t be interested. Come, Mr. Cat, let’s show Pinocchio the way home.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你是说我可以有更多的钱吗？”&nbsp;匹诺曹问。他对这件事感到很惊讶。&nbsp;“我需要工作吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦，不用！”&nbsp;猫笑着说，&nbsp;“我们绝不会建议你做这样的傻事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You mean I could have more money?” Pinocchio asked, surprised at this new idea. “Would I have to work for it?” <br>
            “Oh no!” the cat said, laughing. “We would never suggest such a silly thing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            我们知道一块秘密的土地，叫做傻瓜福地。如果你把你的钱在半夜里种下去，给它浇上水，第二天再回来的时候，它就会长成一棵摇钱树。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            We know of a secret field called the Field of Follies. If you plant your money in that field at midnight, water it, and come back the next day, it will have grown into a money tree.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哇，那我们就真的变成有钱人了！”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。他想起蟋蟀先生说过，诚实的工作是赚钱的最佳途径。&nbsp;“但是，如果我有很多钱，杰佩托会更加爱我的。请你快告诉我这块儿地在哪里吧。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Wow, then we would be really rich!” Pinocchio said. He could imagine Mr. Cricket telling him that honest work was the best way to be rich. “But, Geppetto would love me so much more if I was rich now. Please, would you show me this Field of Follies?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是，他们出发去寻找那块神奇的土地了。他们走了一整天，一直走到晚上。&nbsp;“欢迎来到傻瓜福地，匹诺曹。”&nbsp;猫说，“你可以把金子种在你想要摇钱树生长的位置。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So, off they went to find the Field of Follies. They walked all day and into the evening. <br>
            “Welcome to the Field of Follies, Pinocchio,” said the cat. “Plant your gold wherever you want your money tree to grow!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹非常兴奋。他挖了一个洞，小心地把黄金放到里面，然后盖上了泥土。&nbsp;“现在，你应该浇水。在你去找水的时候，猫先生和我会在这里帮你守护你的钱。”&nbsp;狐狸说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio was very excited. He dug a hole, carefully placed his gold inside, and covered the hole with dirt. <br>
            “Now, you must water it. Mr. Cat and I will guard the money while you run to get some water,” said the fox.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹并没有觉得一只瞎眼的猫来帮他看钱是一件多么奇怪的事情。他跑开了，然后迅速地拎回了一桶水。给金子浇完水之后，剩下的就只是等待了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio did not think it was strange for a blind cat to stand guard. He ran off and quickly returned with a bucket of water. After the gold had been watered, there was nothing left to do but wait.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在，我们去附近找一个谷仓吧。那样我们就可以休息一会儿了。”&nbsp;猫说。&nbsp;“是的，如果我们留在这儿看着，树就不会长成。”&nbsp;狐狸赞同地说。&nbsp;于是，带着马上就会发财的想法，他们离开了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Now, let’s go find a nearby barn so we can rest,” said the cat. <br>
            “Yes, if we stay here and watch, the tree will not grow,” agreed the fox. <br>
            So, off they went with happy thoughts of being rich.

            “Here is the field,” Pinocchio said, “but, where is my money tree?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他找遍了整个土地，但没有找到他的摇钱树。&nbsp;<br>
            “明明就是这里呀。”&nbsp;他疑惑不解地说，&nbsp;“也许金子们忘了要长出来！还是把它们挖出来看看吧。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He looked all over the field, but saw nothing that looked like a money tree. <br>
            “I know this is the right field,” he said, puzzled. “Maybe the gold forgot to grow! I will dig it out.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是匹诺曹开始挖他的金子。他挖呀挖呀，直到他被泥土覆盖。&nbsp;这个洞比他开始挖的那个洞要大五倍。但他还是没有找到他的金子。&nbsp;<br>
            “明明就是这里呀！我的金子呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So Pinocchio got down and began to dig. He dug and dug until he was covered in dirt. This hole was five times as big as the first hole. But he saw no gold! <br>
            “I know this is the right place! Oh! Where is my gold?” Pinocchio cried.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在他的头顶，有个人正在嘲笑他。他抬头望去，看到了蟋蟀先生。<br>
            “你在这儿干什么？”&nbsp;匹诺曹叫道，“你为什么嘲笑我？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Above his head, someone was laughing. Pinocchio looked up and saw Mr. Cricket.<br>
            “What are you doing here?” Pinocchio shouted. “And why are you laughing at me?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你这个傻男孩儿，匹诺曹。”&nbsp;蟋蟀先生回答道，“我曾经警告过你交朋友和做决定的时候要谨慎，但是你不听我的。那只狐狸和猫已经偷走了你的金子。他们现在已经跑得远远的了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You are a foolish boy, Pinocchio,” Mr. Cricket replied. “I tried to warn you about bad friends and bad choices. But you didn’t listen to me. The fox and cat have stolen your gold. They are very far away by now.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不！不！”&nbsp;匹诺曹喊道。<br>
            他坐在地上哭了起来。“我一定要告诉警察，他们会帮助我的。”&nbsp;<br>
            匹诺曹跑到了附近小镇的监狱。他把发生的事情告诉了警察。但是他们并没有帮助他找回金子，反而把他关进了监狱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh no! Oh no!” Pinocchio said. He sat in the dirt and cried. “I must tell the police. They will help me.”<br>
            So Pinocchio ran off to the nearest town and went to the jail. He told the police his story. But, they did not help Pinocchio find his gold. They locked him in prison!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哈哈哈。真是一个傻孩子。看来我们又能收到小费了，是吧？”&nbsp;一个人向另一个人说道。<br>
            “不，你不明白。我没有做错任何事情！拜托了！请帮我找到我的金子。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Ha-ha-ha. What a foolish boy. Looks like another tip for us, huh, partner?” one said to the other.<br>
            “No, you don’t understand. I did nothing wrong! Please! Help me find my gold,” Pinocchio said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不，你这一辈子都会呆在这里面的！”&nbsp;狱卒笑着说。<br>
            匹诺曹并不知道，这个小镇是属于那只狐狸和猫的。<br>
            他们收买了狱卒，并要求他们把那些被他们抢劫的人关起来。因为狐狸和猫，这些警察变得很有钱。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Nope, you are stuck here for the rest of your life!” the jailer said, laughing.<br>
            Pinocchio didn’t know that the fox and cat owned this town. They paid the jailers for locking up people they had robbed. The police had become very rich because of the fox and cat.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹一整天都坐在监狱里面。但是他并没有哭。他抬头看着星星说，“蟋蟀先生的话是对的。我真是一个傻孩子。我做了许多错误的选择。因为我，金子丢了。如果有人能把我救出去，从今以后我一定会做一个很乖的孩子。拜托了，有人在吗？我需要帮助。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio sat in prison all day. But he didn’t cry. He looked out at the stars and said, “Mr. Cricket is right. I have been a foolish boy. I have made bad choices. It is my fault the gold is gone. If only someone would save me. I know I will be a good boy from now on. Please, is anyone listening? I need help.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的，我在听着。”&nbsp;一个甜美的声音说。就在这时，匹诺曹看到一个很小的蓝色的光飘过他的窗户。<br>
            “谁在那儿？”&nbsp;他问。<br>
            “我是蓝色小仙女。我保护好孩子们不受伤害。我是来帮助你的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Yes, I am listening,” said a pretty voice. Just then, Pinocchio saw a small blue light fly by his window. <br>
            “Who is out there?” he asked. <br>
            “I am the Blue Fairy. I protect good children from harm. I am here to help you.”

            “请把我从监狱里面救出去吧。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。<br>
            “你为什么会在监狱里呢？”&nbsp;仙女问，“你做错了什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我没有做错什么。”&nbsp;匹诺曹回答，“是狐狸和猫骗了我。他们偷走了我的金子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Please, get me out of jail," said Pinocchio.<br>
            "Why are you in jail?" asked the fairy. "What have you done wrong?"<br>
            "Nothing at all," said Pinocchio. "The fox and the cat tricked me. They stole all my gold coins."

            “是我赚来的钱。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说，“我原来在一个节目里面表演。”&nbsp;<br>
            匹诺曹的鼻子突然开始变长。没几秒钟，他的鼻子就变成了6尺长！匹诺曹惊讶地看着他的鼻子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where did you get the money?" asked the Blue Fairy.<br>
            "I earned it," said Pinocchio. "I starred in a show."<br>
            Pinocchio's nose suddenly started to grow. Within seconds, it was six inches long! Pioncchio stared at his nose in surprise.
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你爸爸同意你在剧院里表演吗？”&nbsp;蓝色小仙女平静地问。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Calmly, the Blue Fairy asked, "Did your father say you could work in the theater?"<br>
            "Oh yes, Blue Fairy," said Pinocchio. "My father told me I would be a great actor!"

            因为再次撒谎，他的鼻子变得更长了。很快，匹诺曹的鼻子就长到了8尺长！<br>

            “我在嘲笑你的谎言。”&nbsp;仙女说，“当你说谎的时候，真的很容易被看穿。因为每次你说谎，你的鼻子都会变长。”&nbsp;

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A few hours later, Pinocchio began to get hungry. He saw a nearby grapevine and decided to ask the owner for some grapes. As he crossed the field, he fell into a trap. “Oh no! Someone, help me!” Pinocchio cried.

            几个小时过去了，匹诺曹听到一些声音。他向狗窝外望去。已经是晚上了！他看到四只黄鼠狼站在鸡窝旁边。“你们是谁？”&nbsp;匹诺曹问道。他们停了下来。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Many hours passed, and Pinocchio heard voices nearby. He looked outside the doghouse. It was already night! He saw four weasels next to the chicken coop. <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Well, who are you?” one of the weasels asked. “And, where is our friend Oscar?” <br>
            Pinocchio guessed that Oscar was the dog who had died, so he said, “Oscar died this morning. I am the new guard dog. Who are you?” Pinocchio asked again.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们是黄鼠狼，我们是来吃晚餐的。”&nbsp;其中一只黄鼠狼说，“奥斯卡是我们的朋友。你可以和奥斯卡一样跟我们做个交易。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “We are the weasels, and we are here to get dinner,” said one of the weasels. “Oscar was our friend. I will make the same promise to you that I did to him.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每个星期，我们都来这里。奥斯卡保证不会叫。我们会给奥斯卡一只鸡，然后带七只回家作为晚餐。如果你假装睡着了，我们也会留给你一只鸡。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Every week, we would visit this coop. Oscar promised not to bark. So we would give one chicken to Oscar and take seven home for dinner. If you pretend to sleep, we will leave one chicken for you too.”

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Before Pinocchio answered, the weasels snuck into the chicken coop. BAM! Pinocchio locked the door behind them and began to bark. <br>

            Pinocchio nodded again, this time, with a big smile.

            他们跳上了马车，前往小岛的尽头。

            This sounded great to Pinocchio. So he followed the boys to the end of the village. There, they met a man with a wagon full of boys. The wagon was pulled by very sad donkeys wearing clothes. But the boys didn’t notice them.    <br>
            They jumped into the wagon and rode to the end of the island.

            Pinocchio and the boys ran to the ferry. Pinocchio noticed there were a lot of donkeys coming off the ferry. But he didn’t stop to wonder why. He wanted to be a real boy. And he wanted to save his father. At Paradisle, he could do both and he wouldn’t have to work!

            “Yes, and if you do the opposite, you will return to being a wooden boy,” she said, then disappeared. <br>
            “The opposite of selfish and lazy is generous and hardworking. How can I be generous and hardworking?” he wondered. <br>
            Then, Pinocchio got an idea.

            匹诺曹的想法是这样的。他想到了需要帮助的人。他想到了孤独和走失的人。他想到了需要朋友的人。他想到了孤儿。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio’s idea was this. He thought of someone who needed help. He thought of someone who was lonely and lost. He thought of someone who needed a friend. He thought of an orphanage.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹知道没有家人是什么感觉。很多陌生人曾对他很友善，而且给了他很多东西。他记得蓝色小仙女说过，“从陌生人那里得到帮助是件好事，但是帮助陌生人是件更好的事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio knew how it felt not to have a family. Many strangers had been kind to him and had given him a lot. And he remembered the Blue Fairy saying, “It is a great thing to receive help from a stranger, but it is an even greater thing to give help to a stranger.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要去帮助那些没有爸爸妈妈的孩子。”&nbsp;他决定。<br>
            匹诺曹终于找到了通往孤儿院的路。那个地方很小，院子里有很多枯树枝。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I am going to help children who don’t have a mom or dad,” he decided. <br>
            Pinocchio eventually found his way to an orphanage. It was small, and there were many dead trees in the yard.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要帮他们移开这些树枝。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。<br>
            他用绳子把树枝捆起来，然后拉走。他把院子里所有的树枝都清理干净。<br>
            孩子们看到了他，都从里面跑了出来。<br>
            “哇，一头驴！”&nbsp;他们喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I will help move these trees,” Pinocchio said. <br>
            He looped a rope around a tree and pulled. He did this for every tree until the yard was clean. <br>
            The children saw him in the yard and ran outside.<br>
            “Yeah, a donkey!” they cried.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “多么棒的驴啊。”&nbsp;一个女孩儿说。<br>
            “我们能骑你吗，驴先生？”&nbsp;她问。<br>
            匹诺曹点点头。于是女孩儿爬了上去。他带着一个又一个孩子绕着院子走。孩子们开心地笑了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “What a nice donkey,” one girl said. “Could we ride on your back, Mr. Donkey?” she asked. <br>
            Pinocchio nodded, and the girl climbed on. One by one, he gave the children rides around the yard. They laughed and were very happy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            晚饭的时候，孩子们跑进屋里吃通心面条。匹诺曹很饿，他很想进屋。但是他想变得慷慨一些。于是他吃了些草，睡在了外面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When it was dinnertime, the children ran inside to eat macaroni. Pinocchio was hungry, and he wanted to be inside. But he also wanted to be generous. So he ate grass and slept outside.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每天，匹诺曹都在孤儿院工作。他让孩子们骑着他去城里买食物。他把草吃短点，好让孩子们玩得安全。他搬运柴火。有任何艰难的工作，匹诺曹都很乐意帮忙。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Every day, Pinocchio worked at the orphanage. He gave the children rides into town to buy food. He cropped the grass short so the children could play safely. He carried firewood. If there was any hard job to do, Pinocchio was happy to help.

            下午，他会坐在房子外面听孩子们上课。<br>
            “孩子们，二加二等于几？”&nbsp;老师问。<br>
            “四！”&nbsp;他们都喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the afternoons, he would sit outside the house and listen to the children study their lessons. <br>
            “Children, what is two plus two?” the teacher asked. <br>
            “Four!” they all shouted.

            “很好。”&nbsp;老师说，“现在，到了讲故事的时间了。”&nbsp;<br>
            匹诺曹喜欢听老师讲故事，所以他听得很认真。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Children, where is our nation’s capital?” the teacher asked. <br>

            “Good,” the teacher said. “Now, it is time for a story.” <br>
            Pinocchio loved the teacher’s stories, so he listened carefully.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “从前有一个名叫约拿的男人。他不想听上帝的话，于是逃跑了。但是他被一只鲸鱼吞到了肚子里！他在鲸鱼的肚子里待了三天。由于他非常后悔没有听上帝的话，鲸鱼又把他吐了出来。我们要听上帝的话，孩子们。”&nbsp;

            “Once there was a man named Jonah. He tried to disobey God, and he ran away. But he was swallowed by a whale! He lived in the whale for three days. He was sorry for disobeying God, so the whale spit him onto a beach. We must always obey God, children.”

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹站了起来。“约拿在鲸鱼肚子里活着？那么爸爸也一定在鲸鱼肚子里活着！蓝色小仙女说过他很安全，还被藏起来了。他一定是在鲸鱼肚子里！噢，如果我待在学校里，我早就能听到这些故事了。我早就可以把爸爸救出来了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio sat up. “Jonah lived inside a whale? Of course! Father must be living inside the whale too! The Blue Fairy said he was safe and hidden. That must be where he is! Oh, if only I had stayed in school. I would have learned this story a long time ago. I could have saved Father faster!”

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，匹诺曹发生了巨大的变化。他的蹄子变成了手指，他的耳朵变小了，他的毛脱落了，他的声音听起来又像男孩儿了。<br>
            “成功了！”&nbsp;他喊道，“蓝色小仙女是对的！我既慷慨又勤劳。现在，我又能做回男孩儿了！”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just as Pinocchio said this, a big change happened. His hooves changed to fingers. His ears got small again. His fur fell off. And he sounded like a boy again. <br>
            “It worked!” he cried. “The Blue Fairy was right! I was generous and worked hard. Now, I can be a boy again!”

            匹诺曹跑向大海。因为他在孤儿院工作过，所以他很强壮。他顶着海浪轻松地游着。他游得很快，甚至能与海豚一起游泳。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio ran to the ocean. Because he had worked at the orphanage, he was very strong. It was easy for him to swim through the waves. And he swam so fast that he was able to swim with some dolphins.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你好，海豚！”&nbsp;匹诺曹喊道，“我在寻找一条大鲸鱼。你知道我应该去哪里找吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的，是的。”&nbsp;海豚们说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Hello, dolphins!” Pinocchio called. “I am looking for a large whale. Do you know where I can find it?”  <br>
            “Yeah, yeah” the dolphins said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            海豚围着匹诺曹游了一个大大的圈。一只海豚游到匹诺曹身下，让他可以游得更深一点。海豚们朝新的方向游去。匹诺曹紧紧地抓着。<br>
            “哇，这太有意思了！”&nbsp;他穿过水里的泡泡。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They swam a big circle around him. One dolphin came below Pinocchio to help him swim deeper. The dolphins swam off in a new direction. Pinocchio held on tightly. <br>
            “Whee, this is fun!” he shouted through the bubbles.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            海豚们游得越来越深。匹诺曹能看到前面有一块很大的东西。看起来像是一个蓝色的大房子。是鲸鱼！海豚们游向鲸鱼。<br>
            “你好，大鲸鱼！”&nbsp;它们喊道。<br>
            “你们好。”&nbsp;鲸鱼回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The dolphins dove deeper and deeper. Pinocchio could see something very big ahead. It looked like a big blue house. It was the whale! The dolphins swam near the whale. <br>
            “Hi, big whale!” they called. <br>
            “Hello,” the whale called back.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲸鱼张开嘴说你好的时候，匹诺曹跳进了它的嘴里。<br>
            “里面太黑了！”&nbsp;匹诺曹小心翼翼地沿着鲸鱼的牙齿走着。“但是这里很暖和。”&nbsp;他深入到鲸鱼的喉咙。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the whale opened its mouth to say hello, Pinocchio jumped inside. <br>
            “It’s so dark in here!” Pinocchio said, walking carefully along the whale’s teeth. “It’s nice and warm though.” He walked deep into the whale’s throat.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当匹诺曹走近鲸鱼的胃的时候，一股难闻的味道传了过来。<br>
            “噢，真恶心！”&nbsp;他说，“是什么闻起来那么臭？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是我。”&nbsp;一个声音传来。<br>
            “爸爸？”&nbsp;匹诺曹喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As Pinocchio got closer to the whale’s stomach, he noticed a bad smell. “Oh, that’s gross!” he said. "What smells so bad?” <br>
            “I do,” said a voice. <br>
            “Father?” Pinocchio called.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “匹诺曹，是你吗？”&nbsp;杰佩托回答。虽然他们身在一个难闻的鱼肚子里，但他们从来没这么开心过。他们向着对方跑去，拥抱彼此。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Pinocchio, is that you?” Geppetto called back. Even though they were inside a smelly fish, they had never been happier. They ran across the whale’s stomach and held each other.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “噢，爸爸。你瘦了。很抱歉这么长时间才找到你。请原谅我。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。<br>
            “匹诺曹，你是怎么找到我的？我已经放弃希望了。我以为你也走失了。”&nbsp;杰佩托说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, Father. You are very thin. I am sorry it took me so long to find you. Please forgive me,” Pinocchio said. <br>
            “Pinocchio, how did you find me? I had given up hope. I thought you were lost too,” said Geppetto.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们彼此都有很多问题要问，有很多故事要说。但是鲸鱼在向更深的地方游去。<br>
            “爸爸，我们必须马上逃离这条鲸鱼。”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。<br>
            “没用的。”&nbsp;杰佩托说，“我试过很多次了，但是鲸鱼不肯张开嘴巴。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They both had many questions to ask and even more stories to tell. But the whale was swimming deeper. <br>
            “Father, we must get out of this whale quickly,” said Pinocchio. <br>
            “It is no use,” said Geppetto. “I have tried many times, but the whale will not open its mouth.”

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹想起约拿的故事。鲸鱼把约拿吐了出来。匹诺曹如何让这条鲸鱼把他们吐出去呢？突然，他想到了办法。<br>
            “爸爸，跟我一起爬到鲸鱼的嘴巴上。来，我帮你。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio remembered the story of Jonah. The whale had spit Jonah out. How could Pinocchio make this whale spit them out? Suddenly, he had an idea.<br>
            “Father, climb with me up to the whale’s mouth. Here, I will help you.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们一起爬了上去，坐在鲸鱼的牙齿旁。<br>
            “你能站起来挠鲸鱼上口腔的痒吗？”&nbsp;匹诺曹说。<br>
            “我可以试试。”&nbsp;杰佩托回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Together, the two climbed up and sat on the whale’s teeth.<br>
            “Can you reach up and tickle the top of the whale’s mouth?” Pinocchio asked. <br>
            “I will try,” answered Geppetto.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他站起来，用手挠鲸鱼的痒。鲸鱼开始快速地向上游去。鲸鱼的舌头开始颤抖。<br>
            “阿嚏！”&nbsp;鲸鱼打了个喷嚏。就这样，它把父子俩吐到了沙滩上。<br>
            “耶，我们成功了！”&nbsp;匹诺曹欢呼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He stood up tall and tickled the whale. The whale started to swim up very quickly. Its tongue started to jump. <br>
            “Ahh­-ahh-­choo!”the whale said, and it sneezed them onto the sand.<br>
            “Hooray, we made it!” cheered Pinocchio.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “噢，你太聪明了，儿子！”&nbsp;杰佩托说。<br>
            “你怎么知道去挠鲸鱼的痒？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我从学校里学到的知识中获得了灵感。”&nbsp;匹诺曹笑着说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, you are so smart, son!” said Geppetto. <br>
            “How did you know to tickle the whale?” <br>
            “I got the idea from something I learned at a school," Pinocchio said, smiling.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，那只鲸鱼滑到沙滩上开始说话。它的声音又温柔又好听。<br>
            “做得好，匹诺曹。”&nbsp;它说，“你已经证明了自己是个好孩子。你尊重你的爸爸。你很听话，也很慷慨。你冒着生命危险救了他。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then, the whale began to slide up onto the sand and speak. Its voice was soft and pretty. <br>
            “Well done, Pinocchio,” it said. “You have proven yourself to be a good boy. You have honored your father. You have been obedient and generous. You have risked your life to save him.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，那只鲸鱼消失了。蓝色小仙女出现在了那里。<br>
            “蓝色小仙女！你就是那条鲸鱼？”&nbsp;匹诺曹惊讶地问。<br>
            “是的。我保护着杰佩托，直到你学会做一个好孩子。再见，朋友们。祝你们幸福。”&nbsp;说完，蓝色小仙女飞走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly, the whale vanished. In its place stood the Blue Fairy.<br>
            “Blue Fairy! You were the whale?" Pinocchio asked, very surprised. <br>
            “Yes. I kept Geppetto safe until you learned to be a good boy. Farewell, gentlemen. I wish you a happy life together,” she said, and the Blue Fairy flew away.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            匹诺曹和杰佩托挥着手告别。匹诺曹挥手时看到了自己的手。它变成了一只真正男孩儿的手。<br>
            “啊！我是一个真正的男孩儿了！爸爸，看！我是真的！”&nbsp;他喊道。<br>
            爸爸和儿子笑了，他们拥抱后，跳着舞，高高兴兴地回了家。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pinocchio and Geppetto waved good-bye. As Pinocchio waved, he looked at his hand. It was the hand of a real boy. <br>
            “Ah! I’m a real boy! Father, look! I’m really real!” he cried. <br>
            Father and Son laughed and hugged, and they danced all the way home.
