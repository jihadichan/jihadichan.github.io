        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很久很久以前，有一座山，山顶上有块石头。天地日月每天都对这块石头施展着法术。有一天，这块石头裂开了。一只猴子躺在石头里。<br>
            猴子站起身来舒展着身体。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            From the beginning of time, a rock had sat high on top of a mountain. The sun, the moon, Heaven, and Earth all worked their magic on the rock. One day the rock split open. Inside was a monkey.<br>
            The monkey stood up and stretched.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，猴子的双眼射出了强光。不一会儿，这道光就照到了天庭的凌霄宝殿。<br>
            天庭的最高统治者玉帝坐起身来。他扭头看着站在自己身边的一个天将。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly powerful light shot from his eyes. For a moment the light reached the Cloud Palace in Heaven.<br>
            The Jade Emperor, ruler of Heaven, sat up. He turned to one of his captains, who was standing nearby.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “去看看哪里来的光。”&nbsp;玉帝说。<br>
            “遵命，陛下。”&nbsp;天将回答。<br>
            天将快速走出了凌霄宝殿。他一路冲出了南天门，向下界看去，结果看到了那只猴子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Find out what caused that light,” said the emperor.<br>
            "Yes, Your Majesty,” said the captain.<br>
            The captain rushed out of the hall. He looked out the southern gate of Heaven and saw the monkey on Earth below.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那道光不见了，但这位天将的眼睛有法力。他可以看到之前发生的一切。<br>
            “有意思。”&nbsp;天将说。<br>
            “怎么了？”&nbsp;天将回到天宫时，玉帝问道。“那光是从哪里来的？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The light was gone. But the captain had magical sight. He could see everything that had just happened.<br>
            "Interesting," said the captain.<br>
            "Well?" said the Jade Emperor when the captain returned. "What caused the light?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是一只猴子弄出来的。”&nbsp;天将说。<br>
            “猴子？”&nbsp;玉帝问。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;天将回答道，“他在人间的花果山上。那山上有块石头。那猴子就是从石头里蹦出来的。那道光是从猴子的眼睛里发出来的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It was a monkey," said the captain.<br>
            "A monkey?" asked the Jade Emperor.<br>
            "Yes," said the captain. "He's on the Fruit and Flower Mountain, down on Earth. There had been a rock on the mountain. The monkey came from the rock. The light shone from the monkey's eyes."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            玉帝想了一会儿，然后耸耸肩。“那我就觉得不奇怪了。”&nbsp;他说，“天地合力之时，总有奇妙的事情发生。”&nbsp;<br>
            日子一天天过去，这只猴子学会了走、跑和爬。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The emperor thought for a moment and then shrugged. "I'm not surprised," he said. "Amazing things happen when Heaven and Earth work together."<br>
            As time passed, Monkey learned to walk, run, and climb.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他喝的是小溪里的水，吃的是草和树叶。他摘果子，在山洞和山顶探险。他成了其他所有猴子的朋友。到了晚上，他就在一个悬崖下睡觉。<br>
            有一天早上，天气非常热，所有的猴子都在树荫里玩耍。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He drank from streams and ate grasses and leaves. He gathered fruit and explored caves and mountaintops. He became friends with all the other monkeys. At night he slept under a cliff.<br>
            One very hot morning, all the monkeys were playing in the shade.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “今天太热了！”&nbsp;有只猴子叫道，“我们去小溪里玩儿吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            “好主意！”&nbsp;另一只猴子回答道。<br>
            一群猴子跑到了小溪边。水流冲击着石头，激起了朵朵水花。<br>
            猴子们跳进了清凉的溪水里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It is so hot today!" cried one monkey. "Let's play in the stream."<br>
            "Good idea!" said another monkey.<br>
            The monkeys ran to the stream. The water rolled and bounced over the rocks. <br>
            The monkeys jumped into the cool water.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所有猴子都在水里玩耍。<br>
            过了一会儿，有只猴子挠了挠脑袋。“我们都喜欢这条小溪。”&nbsp;她说，“我们喝小溪的水。我们在溪里游泳。我们知道它一路流到海里去，但有谁知道这条小溪的源头在哪里吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone splashed and played.<br>
            After a few minutes, one monkey scratched her head. "We all love this stream," she said. "We drink from it. We swim in it. We know that it flows all the way to the ocean. But does anyone know where the stream begins?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            猴子们你看看我，我看看你，都摇头。<br>
            “我们今天也没什么事情做。”&nbsp;那只猴子继续说道，“不如我们沿着小溪走，去找找它的源头？”&nbsp;<br>
            “听上去挺有趣的。”&nbsp;另一只猴子说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They all looked at one another and shook their heads.<br>
            "We have nothing to do today," the monkey continued. "Why don't we follow the stream to find its source?"<br>
            "That sounds like fun," said another monkey.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那我们走吧！”&nbsp;第三只猴子说。<br>
            猴子们都从水里跳了出来。他们沿着小溪一路走，从这棵树荡到那棵树上。他们跳过一块块岩石，向山上爬去。他们越爬越高，最后在一处巨大的瀑布前停住了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let's go!" said a third monkey.<br>
            Everyone jumped out of the water. They ran alongside the stream and swung from tree to tree. They jumped over rocks and climbed up steep cliffs. Higher and higher they went up the mountain until they reached an enormous waterfall.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            空气里有很多水雾，水流下来，发出巨大的声音。<br>
            “我想知道那瀑布后面是什么。”&nbsp;有只猴子说。<br>
            “我也想知道。”&nbsp;另一只猴子说，“但没人能穿过瀑布啊。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mist filled the air. The water crashed down, roaring like thunder.<br>
            "I wonder what's behind that waterfall," said one monkey.<br>
            "Me too," said a second monkey. "But nobody could jump through it."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “只要谁可以穿过瀑布再活着回来，我们就封他为王。”&nbsp;一只长臂猿说，“有人敢去试试吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            猴子们你看看我，我看看你，都摇着头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Whoever can jump through and come back alive will be our king," said a gibbon. "Is anyone brave enough to try?"<br>
            All the monkeys looked at one another. They shook their heads.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不敢试。”&nbsp;一只高高的猴子说。<br>
            “我也不敢。”&nbsp;一只矮猴子说。<br>
            有人喊道：“我来！”&nbsp;<br>
            猴子们纷纷给那个说话的猴子让出道来。是那只石头里蹦出来的猴子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm not going to try," said a tall monkey.<br>
            "Me neither," said a short monkey.<br>
            A voice called out, "I'll do it!"<br>
            Everyone moved out of the way as the speaker stepped forward. It's the monkey jumping out of that rock.。
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你确定要试试吗？”&nbsp;长臂猿问，“这看上去挺危险的。”&nbsp;<br>
            石猴笑了。“我什么都不怕！我回来的时候，就是你们的大王啦！”&nbsp;<br>
            石猴做了个深呼吸，跳进了瀑布里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Are you sure?" asked the gibbon. "It looks dangerous."<br>
            Rock Monkey laughed. "I'm not afraid of anything! And when I come back, I will be king!"<br>
            Monkey took a deep breath and leaped into the waterfall.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            石猴冲过大瀑布，落进了一个大洞里。他瞪大了眼睛。洞里有很多竹子、树，还有美丽的花。洞壁上长满了青苔。一条小溪在洞里流着，闪着光，空气里有很多水雾。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Rock Monkey splashed through the waterfall and landed in a large cave. His eyes opened wide. The cave was filled with bamboo, trees, and beautiful flowers. Moss covered the walls. A stream flowed through the cave, and glowing light and mist filled the air.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            石猴发现了一张长桌，桌上放着碗、杯和碟子。墙边还有一个火炉。在洞的深处，石猴找到了许多屋子，里面有很舒适的床。<br>
            瀑布外面，其他猴子都盯着瀑布。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Rock Monky found a long table with bowls, cups, and plates. A fireplace sat against one wall. Deeper in the cave, Rock Monkey found bedrooms with cozy beds.<br>
            Outside, the other monkeys were looking at the waterfall.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们觉得他成功了吗？”&nbsp;有只猴子问。<br>
            “不。”&nbsp;另一只猴子说，“他可能被瀑布水流冲到下面的河里去了。”&nbsp;<br>
            突然—水花四溅！石猴从瀑布里冲了出来，直接落在了猴子们面前。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Do you think he has succeeded?" asked one monkey.<br>
            "No," said another monkey. "He probably got washed away down the river."<br>
            Suddenly—splash! Rock Monkey shot out of the waterfall and landed in front of the group.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你还活着！”&nbsp;一只猴子说。<br>
            石猴大笑起来：“当然！我们太幸运了！我为大家找到了一个完美的家。跟我来！”&nbsp;<br>
            石猴又跳进了瀑布里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You're alive!" said a monkey.<br>
            Rock Monkey laughed. "Yes! And we are very lucky! I found a perfect home for all of us. Follow me!"<br>
            Rock Monkey jumped back through the water.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有的猴子挠挠头。<br>
            “这看上去还是太危险了。”&nbsp;有只猴子说。<br>
            “我们试一下吧。”&nbsp;长臂猿说。他穿过了瀑布。<br>
            之后，另一只猴子也跳了过去。其他的猴子也跟着跳了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Some of the monkeys scratched their heads.<br>
            "It still looks dangerous," said one monkey.<br>
            "Let's go," said the gibbon. He leaped through the waterfall.<br>
            After that, another monkey jumped through. Then some more jumped.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快所有的猴子都来到了洞里。大家都在洞里跳来跳去，看这看那。<br>
            “这个洞真美。”&nbsp;长臂猿说。<br>
            有些猴子打了起来，相互叫嚷。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon all of the monkeys were in the cave. Everyone ran around to see all the things.<br>
            "This cave is beautiful," said the gibbon.<br>
            Some of the monkeys began fighting and arguing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们开始抢碟子和碗，还有些猴子抢卧室。<br>
            “我先看到这张床的！”&nbsp;一只猴子大叫。<br>
            “不是！”&nbsp;另一只猴子不甘示弱，“是我先看到的！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They grabbed plates and bowls from one another. Others fought over the bedrooms.<br>
            "I saw this bed first!" yelled one monkey.<br>
            "No!" yelled another monkey. "I did!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            石猴看了一会儿他的朋友们，然后交叉着双臂。<br>
            “呃哼！”&nbsp;他清了清嗓子。<br>
            所有的猴子都停下来看着石猴。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Rock Monkey watched his friends for a moment and then folded his arms.<br>

            All the monkeys stopped what they were doing. They looked at Rock Monkey.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是我为大家找到这个洞的。”&nbsp;石猴说，“这就意味着我现在是你们的王。你们为什么不向我鞠躬呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “大王说得对。”&nbsp;长臂猿说。他向石猴鞠躬，说：“参见美猴王！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I found this cave for us," said Rock Monkey. "That means I am now your king. Why aren't you bowing to me?"<br>
            "He's right," said the gibbon. He bowed to Monkey and said, "All hail the Monkey King."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            其他猴子也跟着鞠躬。“参见美猴王！”&nbsp;他们大声叫道。<br>
            很多年过去了。猴子们白天在树林和小溪里玩耍。晚上就在洞里睡觉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone else bowed too. "All hail the Monkey King!" they shouted.<br>
            Many years went by. During the day the monkeys played in the forest and the stream. And every night they slept safely in their cave.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一天晚上，猴子们举办了一场盛大的宴会。水果和坚果堆满了桌子。猴子们唱歌跳舞，还有音乐伴奏。<br>
            美猴王坐在他的宝座上微笑着。但是，他的笑容很快就消失了。他皱起了眉头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One night the monkeys and apes had a huge feast. Fruits and nuts covered the table. Monkeys and apes danced and sang while music played.<br>
            Monkey King sat on his throne and smiled. But then his smile faded. Soon he was frowning.

            长臂猿看到了之后，马上走了过来。<br>

            美猴王叹了口气：“我们在这里的生活很美好。”&nbsp;<br>
            “对啊，确实很美好。”&nbsp;长臂猿说，“那您为什么不高兴呢？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The gibbon saw Monkey King and rushed over.<br>
            "Your Majesty," said the gibbon. "You look sad. What's wrong?"<br>
            Monkey King sighed. "Our life here is perfect."<br>
            "Yes, that's true," said the gibbon. "So why are you sad?"

            美猴王半天没说话。然后他说：“总有一天我们会离开这个世界。但是，我希望可以永远这样幸福地活下去。”&nbsp;<br>

            “是的，我想长生不老。”&nbsp;美猴王说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Monkey King was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "Someday our lives will end. I wish this perfect life could last forever."<br>

            "I do," said Monkey.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            长臂猿摸了摸下巴。“那么您必须跟着圣人学习。圣人是非常有智慧的人。他们可以将自己变成其他动物。他们可以在天上飞来飞去。他们也知道怎样才能长生不老。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The gibbon rubbed his chin. "Then you must study with a sage. Sages are very wise people. They can turn themselves into other animals. They can fly through the sky. And they know how to live forever."

            美猴王又笑了。“那我去哪里可以找到圣人呢？”&nbsp;他问。<br>
            “您必须找到有人生活的地方。”&nbsp;长臂猿说，“在那儿您会找到圣人的。”&nbsp;<br>
            第二天一早，美猴王就做了一个小木筏，并在木筏上装了食物。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Monkey King smiled again. "Where can I find a sage?" he asked.<br>
            "You must find a land with people," said the gibbon. "That's where you'll find a sage."<br>
            The next morning Monkey King built a raft and loaded food onto it.

            After Wukong went away, the other three continued west.<br>

            Wujing got up and went to look for Bajie. "Mmm," said a voice suddenly. "Yummy noodles!"<br>

            与此同时，唐僧感觉有点儿无聊。他站起来伸了伸腿，四下看了看。<br>
            “这树林真美。”&nbsp;他自言自语地说，“我去周边走走。”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧在树林中边走，边欣赏着花草。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Meanwhile the Tang Monk became bored. He stood up to stretch his legs and looked around.<br>
            "This is a beautiful forest," he said to himself. "I'll take a short walk." <br>
            The monk walked quietly through the woods, admiring flowers and plants as he went.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他走到了树林深处。在树林中央，他看到了一座宝塔。<br>
            “奇怪，这里有个宝塔。”&nbsp;他想，“也许，我们今晚可以在这里过夜。”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧走到宝塔门前，打开了门。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He went deeper and deeper into the forest. Then, in the midst of all the trees, he saw a pagoda.<br>
            "How odd! Here’s a pagoda," he thought. "Maybe we can all stay here tonight." <br>
            The Tang Monk went to the door of the pagoda and opened it.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他大吃一惊。有个妖怪正在里面睡觉！妖怪长了一脸紫色的胡子和一口锋利的尖牙。<br>
            当唐僧想离开的时候，那个妖怪醒了。<br>
            “谁在那里？”&nbsp;妖怪大叫。他站了起来。<br>
            唐僧转过身来，害怕得浑身发抖。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He gasped. A monster was sleeping inside! The monster had a purple beard and long, sharp fangs. <br>
            The Tang Monk tried to walk away, but the monster woke up. <br>
            "Who's there?" called the monster. He stood up.<br>
            The Tang Monk turned around, shaking with fear.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “很抱歉吵醒你了。”&nbsp;他说，“我，呃……”&nbsp;<br>
            妖怪走近了些，笑了。“你是个和尚。”&nbsp;他说。妖怪舔了舔自己的嘴唇。<br>
            “是，是。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“我来自大唐，我……”&nbsp;<br>
            妖怪的眼睛亮了。“你是唐僧！”&nbsp;

            "Sorry to wake you," he said. "I, uh . . ."<br>
            The monster came closer and smiled. "You're a monk," he said. He licked his lips.<br>
            "Y-yes," said the Tang Monk. "I'm from the T-Tang Empire. I . . ."<br>
            The monster's eyes lit up. "You're the Tang Monk!"<br>

            与此同时，悟净顺着八戒的声音找了过去。他在灌木丛背后找到了八戒。八戒在那里睡得正香。<br>
            “能再给我一些豆腐吗？”&nbsp;八戒问。他在说梦话。“好的，请多给点儿。我会把它们吃光的。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟净踢了八戒一脚，说：“醒醒！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Meanwhile Wujing stomped toward Bajie's voice. He peered behind some bushes and saw the pig fast asleep.<br>
            "May I have more tofu?" asked Bajie. He was talking in his sleep. "Yes, please cook lots more. I will eat it all."<br>
            Wujing kicked the pig. "Wake up!"

            “我们都在等着你，你居然在这里睡觉？”&nbsp;悟净说,&nbsp;“我们现在回去找师父。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒叹了口气。他低着头，跟着悟净往回走。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bajie jumped to his feet, wiping drool from the side of his mouth.<br>
            "How dare you sleep while we wait for you?" said Wujing. "Now let's go back to Master."<br>
            Bajie sighed. With his head hung low, he followed Wujing back to the road.<br>

            他和八戒在树林里到处寻找唐僧。很快，他们就看到了那座宝塔。<br>
            他们敲了敲门。妖怪开了门。

            He and Bajie wandered through the woods, looking for the monk. Soon they saw the pagoda.<br>
            They knocked on the door, and the monster answered.<br>

            “我们可怜的女儿。”&nbsp;王后说，“这么多年，她一直被关着。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            That afternoon they reached the palace of the Precious Image Kingdom. The queen was reading the letter from her daughter. Tears were in her eyes.<br>
            "Our poor daughter," said the queen. "She’s been imprisoned all these years."<br>

            国王站了起来，眼睛里冒着怒火。他马上命令身边的侍卫。<br>
            “召集你的部队。”&nbsp;国王说，“我一定要打败那妖怪，救出我的女儿！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The king stood up, his eyes blazing with anger. He called to his general, who was standing nearby.<br>
            "Gather your troops," said the king. "I must defeat the monster and save my daughter!"

    </div>
    <div>

            “对不起，陛下。”&nbsp;侍卫长说，“我们只是凡人。我们怎么才能打败那个厉害的妖怪呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我的两个徒弟都很厉害，陛下。”&nbsp;唐僧开口说，“我保证，他们会把您的女儿救回来的。”&nbsp;<br>
            很快，八戒和悟净回到了宝塔那里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Forgive me, Your Majesty," said the general. "But we are just men. How can we defeat such a powerful monster?"<br>
            "My two followers are powerful spirits, Your Majesty.” The Tang Monk spoke up. “I'm sure they can rescue your daughter."<br>
            Soon Bajie and Wujing were back at the pagoda.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bajie swung his rake. Crash! The door was smashed open. "Get out here, demon!" he shouted.<br>
            The monster ran outside. "This is too much!" he yelled. "I let the monk go free. Why did you smash my door down?"<br>

            妖怪挡住了他们的兵器。他们打了一个多小时。<br>

            悟净非常生气。“八戒！”&nbsp;他大叫，“你去哪里——啊！”&nbsp;<br>
            妖怪打倒了悟净，并把他捆了起来。他把悟净拖进了宝塔，锁在一个房间里。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monster blocked their weapons. They fought for over an hour.<br>
            Finally Bajie, tired from fighting, turned and ran.<br>
            Wujing was furious. "Bajie!" he shouted. "Where are you-—oof!"<br>
            The monster knocked out Wujing and tied him up. He dragged Wujing into the pagoda and locked him in a room.<br>

            "The king knows that the princess is here," said the monster to himself. "But how?" He tapped his chin and thought.<br>

            When Red Boy stood up he spotted something in the sky.<br>

            “大家都起来吧！”&nbsp;悟空叫道。<br>
            他们在森林里睡了一晚。唐僧坐起来舒展了一下身体。悟净睁开眼睛打了个哈欠。<br>
            八戒嘀咕道：“现在太早了，我要再睡一会儿。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Everybody, wake up!" called Wukong.<br>
            Everyone had camped for a night in the woods.  The Tang Monk woke up and stretched. Wujing opened his eyes and yawned.<br>
            Bajie moaned, "It's too early. Let me sleep just a few more hours."<br>

            “八戒，得起来了。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“开始做早饭吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒站了起来。“我们每天就是干活儿。”&nbsp;他说，“做饭……拿行李……走路，走路，走路！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bajie, get up," said the Tang Monk. "Start making some breakfast."<br>
            Bajie got to his feet. "All we do is work," he said. "Cook food . . . carry bags . . . walk, walk, walk!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们有重要使命。”&nbsp;悟净说，“虽然西天取经的路上有很多困难，但是大唐可以得到真经。你应该高兴才是。”&nbsp;<br>
            简单吃过早饭后，这一行人又上路了。他们穿过了一个山谷，又翻过了几座高山。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We're on a noble mission," said Wujing. "Because of our difficult journey, the Tang Empire will have the True Scriptures. You should be happy to do all this work."<br>
            After a quick breakfast, the group started walking. They went through a valley and over some hills.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天下午，他们正走着，突然听到有人在叫喊。<br>
            “听上去好像是有人遇到麻烦了。”&nbsp;唐僧说。<br>
            悟净点点头说：“是的，不知道发生了什么。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你们都在这里等着。”&nbsp;悟空说，“我去看一下。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空跳到空中四下看了看。

            That afternoon while walking they heard someone yelling.<br>
            "It sounds like some people are in trouble," said the Tang Monk.<br>
            Wujing nodded. "Yes. I wonder what's going on."<br>
            "You all wait here," said Wukong. "I'll go and investigate."<br>
            Wukong leaped into the air and looked around.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他看到几个和尚正吃力地推着一辆车。那车里装满了巨大的石头。和尚们的表情非常痛苦。他们的僧袍又脏又破。<br>
            两个道士站在旁边。他们穿得很好。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He saw some monks strenuously pushing a cart. The cart was loaded with big stones. The monks looked miserable. Their robes were dirty and ripped.<br>
            Two Daoist priests stood nearby. They were dressed in fine clothes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “快点儿！”&nbsp;其中一个道士大叫。<br>
            和尚们看上去很害怕。他们用力推得更快了一些。<br>
            “为什么这些和尚要推那车？”&nbsp;悟空想，“他们又为什么怕那些道士呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Work faster!" yelled one of the priests.<br>
            The monks looked frightened. They struggled to move the cart faster.<br>
            "Why are those monks pushing that cart?" thought Wukong. "And why are they scared of the Daoists?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            道士们走后，悟空变成了一个和尚。<br>
            “你们好。”&nbsp;悟空边说，边走近那些和尚们，“你们为什么要推这车啊？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After the Daoists left, Wukong changed into a monk.<br>
            "Hello," said Wukong, walking toward the group of monks. "Why are you pushing this cart?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            和尚们停下来，转身看着悟空。他们看上去都很惊讶。<br>
            “你一定是新来的吧？”&nbsp;一个和尚说，“在他们发现你以前，快点儿离开这儿。”&nbsp;<br>
            “为什么？”&nbsp;悟空问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monks stopped pushing the cart and turned toward Wukong. They looked surprised.<br>
            "You must be new here," one monk said. "You should leave before you're discovered."<br>
            "Why?" asked Wukong.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “道士们控制了这里。”&nbsp;另一个和尚说。<br>
            悟空耸耸肩。“大家可以和平相处啊。”&nbsp;<br>
            “在这儿不行。”&nbsp;第一个和尚说，“我们在这里会受苦的。道士们让我们做苦工。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Daoists are in charge here," said another monk.<br>
            Wukong shrugged. "You can all live together in peace."<br>
            "Not in here," said the first monk. "We suffer here. The Daoists make us do hard work."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “道士们为什么这么对你们？”&nbsp;悟空问。<br>
            “几年前，这里发生了一场旱灾。”&nbsp;和尚说，“庄稼都枯死了，老百姓也都饿死了。我们向佛祖求雨，但是没有下雨。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why do the Daoists treat you so badly?" asked Wukong.<br>
            "Years ago there was a drought," said the monk. "Crops died and people starved. We prayed to Buddha for rain. But no rain came."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “有一天，有个厉害的道士来了。”&nbsp;另一个和尚说，“他叫虎力大仙。他念咒求雨，立刻就下了大雨。从此，道士们就控制了这里。他们毁了所有的寺院。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "One day a powerful Daoist arrived," said the other monk. "He's called the Tiger Immortal. He recited prayers, and right away rain fell. Since then Daoists have been in charge. They destroyed all the monasteries."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “太可恶了。”&nbsp;悟空说，“绝对不能放过那些道士。”&nbsp;<br>
            “道士们不会永远这样对我们的。”&nbsp;第三个和尚说，“有一天晚上，我梦见太白金星。他说有一天有人会来救我们的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's terrible," said Wukong. "Those Daoists can't get away with this."<br>
            "The Daoists won't treat us this way forever," said a third monk. "The spirit of the planet Venus visited us in a dream one night. He said that one day someone would come along to save us."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，是吗？”&nbsp;悟空扬起了眉毛说，“谁会来救你们？”&nbsp;<br>
            “一位厉害的猴仙。”&nbsp;那个和尚说，“他叫孙悟空。他很厉害的。他曾打败了天兵天将！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh really?" Wukong raised an eyebrow. "Who is going to save you?"<br>
            "A fierce monkey spirit," said the monk. "His name is Sun Wukong. He is so powerful that he defeated Heaven’s entire army!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空笑了。“我听说过孙悟空。他确实很厉害。太白金星告诉过你们他长什么样子吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦，有的。”&nbsp;和尚说。<br>
            “如果你们看到孙悟空，能认出他吗？”&nbsp;悟空说，努力忍着不笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong smiled. "I've heard of Sun Wukong. And it's true that he's very powerful. Did Venus tell you what he looks like?"<br>
            "Oh yes," said the monk. <br>
            "So you'll recognize him if you see him?" asked Wukong, trying not to laugh.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “当然。”&nbsp;和尚说，“你为什么这么问？”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空全身发光，变回了原形。<br>
            “孙悟空？”&nbsp;和尚们大叫。他们立刻拜倒在地。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Certainly," said the monk. "Why do you ask?"<br>
            Light sparkled around Wukong. Then he changed back into his original form.<br>
            "Sun Wukong!" cried the monks. They all fell to their knees and bowed.

            A moment later he was standing next to the Tang Monk again.

            "That's wonderful!" said the Tang Monk. "I'm from the Tang Empire, and—"<br>

            The villagers came out from behind the trees and waved. <br>
            "Good-bye!" called a woman.

            The Tang Monk climbed onto the horse, and the group continued on the road.<br>

            "Stop complaining," said Wukong. "The road is flat here. It's not too bad."<br>

            "It looks fine to me," said the monk.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then he saw a room that was lit up. He went inside. Bright sunlight was streaming through a window and onto a table. On the table were three vests.<br>
            "Those vests look magnificent," said Bajie. He shivered. "They also look warm." He looked around.

            "Great!" Wujing grabbed a vest. "I'm freezing."<br>
            Bajie handed a vest to the Tang Monk. "Here you go, Master."

            The monk glared at him. "You must return those vests right away!" <br>

            八戒耸耸肩。“师父，你可以不穿，但我很冷。”&nbsp;

            "Oh, um, sure," said Bajie. "We can do that."<br>

            The Tang Monk trembled with fear. Right away, he fell to his knees and bowed. Bajie and Wujing bowed.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong turned back into a bug and flew down another tunnel. Soon he found a second room. This one was dark and gloomy.<br>
            "This must be the demon's bedroom," thought Wukong. "I'll wait here until the demon goes to sleep." He landed on the ceiling and waited.

    <div>

            不一会儿，赛太岁走进房间来。悟空看见了妖怪脖子上挂着的铃铛。<br>
            “今天真的好忙啊。”&nbsp;妖怪说，“好累啊。”&nbsp;妖怪上床，闭上了眼睛。很快，就大声地打起了呼噜。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A little while later, the Demon of Power came into the room. Wukong could see the bells tied around the demon's neck.<br>
            "What a busy day," said the demon. "I'm tired." The demon climbed into bed and closed his eyes. Soon he was snoring loudly.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空又变回自己的样子。他拔下几根毛变成了跳蚤。那些跳蚤落到妖怪的脖子上开始咬他。<br>
            妖怪挠了挠脖子，翻了个身。然后，他又挠了挠。然后，又挠了挠。最后，妖怪坐了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong turned back into himself. He plucked a few of his hairs and turned them into fleas. The fleas landed on the demon's neck and began biting.<br>
            The demon scratched at his neck and rolled over. Then he scratched some more—and more. Finally the demon sat up.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “怎么脖子这么痒呢？”&nbsp;他说，“可能是因为这几个铃铛。睡觉时，我得把它们摘下来。”&nbsp;<br>
            妖怪把三个铃铛放到了桌子上。几分钟后，他又开始打呼噜。跳蚤重新变成毛，回到了悟空手里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why is my neck so itchy?" he said. "Maybe it's these bells. I'll take them off while I sleep."<br>
            The demon laid the three bells on a table. A few minutes later he was snoring again. The fleas turned back into hairs and returned to Wukong.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，悟空把那些毛变成了三个假铃铛。他把那几个铃铛放到桌子上，把真铃铛放进了上衣里。他看了看正在睡觉的妖怪。<br>
            “在这里用这些铃铛太危险了。”&nbsp;悟空想，“得把妖怪引到外面后，再跟他打。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Next the monkey turned the hairs into three fake bells. He put them on the table and stuck the real bells in his robe. He looked at the sleeping demon.<br>
            "It's too dangerous to use these bells inside," thought Wukong. "I'll get the demon to come outside, and then I'll fight him."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Several little demons sat next to the monster. Wukong flew up on a cloud to get a closer look.<br>

            Bajie swung his rake. The demon headed down the slope of the mountain and ran away. Bajie raced after the demon and was soon out of sight.<br>

            Bajie scratched his head. "I don't know. I defeated that demon and then came back here. Everyone was gone."

            "I was just fighting with the demon!"<br>

            Wukong was confused. "The demon didn't get past me. I was fighting with him until just a moment ago."

            "That's impossible," said Wujing. "After you chased him down the slope, he returned and— Where's Master?"<br>

            “那个妖怪的洞肯定就在附近。”&nbsp;悟净说，“我们找洞吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            三个人开始找妖怪的洞。

            They soon found a cave. Its door was shut.<br>

            A demon inside the cave shrieked and ran into a kitchen. The monster was grinding spices with a mortar and pestle.<br>

            The monster kept grinding. "It's okay! I'm only afraid of Wukong."

            师徒四人在寇员外家呆了一个多月。每次他们要走，寇员外都会求他们再呆几天。<br>
            终于有一天吃早餐时，唐僧坚持要离开。“我们呆在这里的话，是绝对不能取到真经的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For over a month, the travelers stayed at Squire Kou's house. Every time they tried to leave, the squire begged them to stay a few more days.<br>
            Finally, one morning during breakfast, the Tang Monk insisted on leaving. "We'll never fetch the True Scriptures if we stay here.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “求你们别走。”&nbsp;寇员外说，“你们很重要。款待你们，是善行。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我想呆在这里。”&nbsp;八戒说。他咬了一口桃子。<br>
            “不。师父是对的。”&nbsp;悟空说，“我们得继续西行。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Please don't leave," said Squire Kou. "You are very important monks. Having you as guests is a good deed."<br>
            "I'd like to stay here," said Bajie. He took a bite of a peach.<br>
            "No. Master's right," said Wukong. "We must continue our journey."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            寇夫人生气了。“你们真没良心！我们款待你们，照顾你们，而你们却想离开！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们非常感谢。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“但是，我们不能再呆下去了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Lady Kou grew angry. "You are ungrateful! We have fed you and taken care of you. Yet you can't wait to leave!"<br>
            "We are very grateful," said the Tang Monk. "But we cannot stay any longer."
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            早饭后，悟净从寇员外的马厩里牵出马来。八戒整理了行李。唐僧谢过寇员外和寇夫人后，师徒四人继续西行。<br>
            “这些没良心的家伙！”&nbsp;寇夫人嘟囔道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After breakfast Wujing got the horse from Squire Kou's stable. Bajie gathered the bags. The Tang Monk thanked Squire and Lady Kou, and the travelers headed west.<br>
            "These ungrateful people," muttered Lady Kou.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            第二天早上，寇夫人跑到村子的官府。她的眼里充满泪水。“官府大人，我有话要说！”&nbsp;寇夫人哭着说道。<br>
            官府大人马上跑了出来。“寇夫人！您有什么事？”&nbsp;<br>
            “昨晚我家进了强盗。”&nbsp;寇夫人气喘吁吁地说，
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning Lady Kou ran into the town's courthouse. Tears filled her eyes. "I must speak with the judge!" she cried.<br>
            The judge ran out. "Lady Kou! What's wrong?"<br>
            "Robbers broke into our house last night," said Lady Kou breathlessly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            "他们偷走了值钱的东西和两匹马。寇员外想阻止他们，可那些强盗……他们……杀死了我丈夫！”&nbsp;寇夫人大哭起来。<br>
            官府大人大吃一惊。“噢，天啊！您看见强盗们了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            寇夫人抽着鼻子。“是的，还有，我知道他们是谁。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They stole many valuable items and two of our horses. Squire Kou tried to stop them, but the robbers . . . They . . . killed my husband!" Lady Kou burst into tears.<br>
            The judge gasped. "Oh no! Did you see the robbers?"<br>
            Lady Kou sniffed. "Yes, and I know who they are."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他们是谁？”&nbsp;官府大人问。<br>
            寇夫人咬着牙说：“是唐僧和他的徒弟们。”&nbsp;<br>
            官府大人转身对侍卫说：“带上一些人，去抓唐僧和他的徒弟们！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Who are they?" asked the judge.<br>
            Lady Kou gritted her teeth. "The Tang Monk and his companions!"<br>
            The judge turned to a soldier. "Gather some soldiers and arrest the Tang Monk and his companions!"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真高兴可以继续西行。”&nbsp;唐僧说道，“我真希望快点到达西天。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟净点了点头。“我们在寇员外家呆得太久了。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒哼了一声。“应该呆得更久点。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm glad we're headed west again," said the Tang Monk. "I'm eager to reach the Western Paradise."<br>
            Wujing nodded. "We were delayed at Squire Kou's house for too long."<br>
            Bajie snorted. "We should have stayed longer."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，路前方出现了四个男人。他们拿着刀和斧子。他们的马驮着一些大行李。<br>
            “把钱交出来！”&nbsp;一个男人大喊。<br>
            悟空抽出了金箍棒。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly four men stepped onto the road. They carried swords and axes. Their horses carried several large bundles.<br>
            "Give us your money!" shouted one man.<br>
            Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “悟空。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“记住，不可以伤人。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空笑了。“我只是和他们聊聊，师父。”&nbsp;他转身朝向大喊的男人。“我们没钱。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？没钱？”&nbsp;他说，
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wukong," said the Tang Monk. "Remember, you must not harm people."<br>
            Wukong smiled. "I'm just going to talk to them, Master." He turned to the man who had shouted. "We have no money."<br>
            "No money, huh?" said the man.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那我们就得把你们都打一顿了。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空笑了。“你不知道我是谁啊？我是美猴王孙悟空！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不在乎你是谁。”&nbsp;男人说，“我们是危险的强盗！昨晚我们抢劫了一个非常有钱的员外家。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well then, we're going to beat up all of you."<br>
            Wukong laughed. "You don't know who I am? I'm Sun Wukong, the Monkey King!"<br>
            "I don't care who you are," said the man. "We're dangerous robbers! Last night we robbed a very wealthy squire."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            唐僧扬起了眉毛。“员外？”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空迅速念了个咒语，冻住了强盗们。悟净跑向马，打开了一个盒子。里面有盘子、宝石，还有其他值钱的东西。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk raised his eyebrows. "A squire?"<br>
            Wukong quickly recited a spell, which froze the robbers. Wujing rushed to the horses and opened one of the bundles. Inside were dishes, jewels, and other valuable items.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟净吓了一跳。“这些东西是寇员外的！马也是！”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧咬了咬嘴唇。“寇员外是好人。我们得把他的东西还给他。”&nbsp;<br>
            大家都同意了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wujing gasped. "These items belong to Squire Kou! So do the horses!"<br>
            The Tang Monk bit his lip. "Squire Kou is a good man. We must return his belongings."<br>
            Everyone agreed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空又念另一个咒语，冰化了。悟空变大，眼里冒火。“马上离开这里！”&nbsp;他大声说道，“还有，绝对不要再偷东西！”&nbsp;<br>
            强盗们大叫着逃走了。<br>
            师徒四人牵着寇员外的马又朝村子走去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong recited another spell, and the ice became unfrozen. Wukong grew large, and fire burned in his eyes. "Get out of here!" he thundered. "And never steal again!"<br>
            The robbers screamed and ran away.<br>
            The travelers headed back toward town with the squire's horses.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这时，他们看见一些官府的人。他们都骑着马。<br>

            “我想知道他们要干什么。”&nbsp;唐僧说。<br>
            一个人用剑对准了师徒四人。“站住，小偷们！我要把你们都抓起来！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon they saw a group of soldiers. They were riding on horses.<br>
            "Those soldiers are riding toward us," said Wujing.<br>
            "I wonder what they want," said the Tang Monk.<br>
            One of the soldiers pointed a sword at the travelers. "Stop, thieves! You're all under arrest!"

            官府的人把师徒四人又带回了村子。<br>
            “你们昨晚抢劫了寇员外的家。”&nbsp;一个人说。

            "This is ridiculous," said the Tang Monk. "Why are we under arrest?"<br>

            Wukong could tell that the soldier didn't believe him.<br>

            悟空一行人走过了西天。这条路通往灵山，路的两边鲜花盛开。<br>
            八戒抬头看那巨大的山，摇了摇头。“爬那座山可不太容易。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong and his companions walked through the Western Paradise. The road led to the Spirit Mountain, and flowers bloomed along the road.<br>
            Bajie looked up at the huge mountain and shook his head. "It won't be easy to climb that."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空笑了。“你别拜托我抱你啊！”&nbsp;<br>
            很快，师徒四人走到一个水流很急的大河边。河水拍打着尖尖的岩石，水朝四方溅起。<br>
            “这条河看起来很危险。”&nbsp;悟净说，“可是，要去灵山，就得过河。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong laughed. "Don't ask me to carry you!"<br>
            The travelers soon arrived at a river with a strong current. Waves crashed into jagged rocks, spraying water everywhere.<br>
            "This river looks dangerous," said Wujing. "But we must cross it to get to the Spirit Mountain."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            八戒叹了口气。“我们绝对不能安全过河的，我们还是回家吧。<br>
            “不可以。”&nbsp;悟空说，“看那边。”&nbsp;<br>
            悟空指着上流那边。有一个细细的木头横跨在大河上。木头下面水流很急，木头摇摇晃晃的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bajie sighed. "We will never be able to cross this river safely. Let's just go home."<br>
            "Nonsense," said Wukong. "Look over there."<br>
            Wukong pointed upstream. A thin log lay across the river. It wobbled and shook as the water rushed under it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            唐僧看了看木头。“别傻了，悟空。我们不能用那个木头过河。它太细了，而且看起来非常滑。”&nbsp;<br>
            “可是，那个木头是我们去灵山的唯一方法。”&nbsp;悟空说，“你得相信它是安全的。看我！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk looked at the log. "Don't be silly, Wukong. We can't walk across that log—it's too thin. And it looks quite slippery."<br>
            "But that log is the only way to reach the Spirit Mountain," said Wukong. "You must believe that it's safe. Watch me!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空跳到木头上跑过去，又跑了回来。“看见了吧？”&nbsp;他说，“很安全。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒哼了一声。“你很轻，悟空。可是，如果我走上那个木头，它就会断的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong hopped onto the log and ran across the river and back. “See?" he said. "It's safe."<br>
            Bajie snorted. "You don't weigh much, Wukong. But if I step on that log, it will break."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我相信悟空。”&nbsp;悟净说，“我们得从木头上走过去。”&nbsp;<br>
            “跟我来，师父。”&nbsp;悟空说。他把唐僧朝木头那边拉。<br>
            唐僧吓得发抖。“别让我从那上面走过去！我掉到河里会淹死的！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I believe Wukong," said Wujing. "We must walk across the log."<br>
            "Follow me, Master," said Wukong. He pulled the Tang Monk toward the log.<br>
            The monk trembled with fear. "Don't make me walk across that! I'll fall into the river and drown!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那就从河上面飞过去。”&nbsp;八戒提议，“我们可以抱着师父和马过去。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不行。”&nbsp;悟空主张说，“师父得一个人完成取经历程。我们在这儿是为了保护师父，不是为了抱他过河。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let's just fly over the river," suggested Bajie. "We can carry Master and the horse."<br>
            "No," insisted Wukong. "The Tang Monk must make the entire journey by himself. We're here to protect him, not to carry him.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            师父如果不亲自一步一步地走，佛祖就不会允许师父拿到真经的。”&nbsp;<br>
            就在这时，一个划着小船的老人出现了。“我可以帮你们过河。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Buddha won't allow Master to have the True Scriptures if he doesn't take every step himself."<br>
            Just then an old man appeared in a boat. "I can take you across the river," said the man.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢您。”&nbsp;唐僧说。他朝河岸走去。“我的徒弟让我从那个木头上走过去……”&nbsp;唐僧吓了一跳。<br>
            “船有问题。”&nbsp;他对老人说，“船没有底！进水呢！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thank you," said the Tang Monk. He walked to the riverbank. "My companion wanted me to walk across that log, but—" The monk gasped.<br>
            "There's something wrong with your boat," he said to the man. "It has no bottom! Water is flowing in!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “船很安全。”&nbsp;老人说，“赶紧上船吧。佛祖等着呢。”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧犹豫了一下，上了船。他看到自己没有沉下去，大吃一惊。他坐在船边，悟净把马牵到了船上。八戒和悟空跟在后面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The boat is safe," said the man. "Please climb in. Buddha is waiting."<br>
            With a bit more hesitation, the Tang Monk stepped into the boat. He was shocked to find that he didn't sink. He sat on the edge of the boat as Wujing led the horse aboard. Bajie and Wukong followed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            船在河里走得很快。突然，传来扑通一声。<br>
            唐僧看了看河水，一具尸体在朝下游飘。他大叫了一声。“有人掉进水里死了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The boat glided swiftly across the river. Suddenly there was a splash.<br>
            The Tang Monk looked at the water and saw a body floating downstream. He screamed. "A man has drowned!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空把手放在唐僧肩膀上，笑了。“那是你啊，师父。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;唐僧说，“是我？”&nbsp;<br>
            “悟空说得对！”&nbsp;八戒大喊，“那的确是你！”&nbsp;<br>
            “你再看看，师父。”&nbsp;悟净笑着说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong put his hand on the monk's shoulder and smiled. "It's you, Master."<br>
            "What?" said the monk. "Me?"<br>
            "Wukong is right!" cried Bajie. "It is you!"<br>
            "Look again, Master," said Wujing, smiling.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            唐僧更仔细地看了看尸体。那尸体穿着和自己一模一样的袈裟。<br>
            “真的是我。”&nbsp;唐僧安静地说，“可是，怎么会……？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你扔掉了人类的身体，师父。”&nbsp;悟空说，“现在，你是仙人了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk looked at the body more carefully. It was wearing the same Buddhist robe that he was wearing. <br>
            "It is me," said the monk quietly. "But how . . . ?"<br>
            "You got rid of your mortal body, Master," said Wukong. "You're a spirit now."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “师父也和我们一样了！”&nbsp;八戒开心地笑了。<br>
            船很快就到了对面河岸。师徒四人从船上下来。他们走在灵山的山坡上时，唐僧惊讶得哈哈大笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You're one of us!" Bajie beamed.<br>
            The boat soon reached the other riverbank, and the travelers stepped out. As they walked up the slope of the Spirit Mountain, the Tang Monk laughed in amazement.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我感觉身体很轻！”&nbsp;他说，“我觉得我能跑到山上！”&nbsp;<br>
            “太好了。”&nbsp;八戒说，“也许可以抱着我走呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            大家都笑了。他们继续上山。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I feel so light!" he said. "I feel like I could run right up this mountain!"<br>
            "Good," said Bajie. "Perhaps you could carry me?"<br>
            Everybody laughed as they continued up the mountain.

            突然，河里浮上来一个巨大的东西。是只巨大的老龟。

            "Good," said the turtle. "Did you ask Buddha when I would be reborn as a human?"

            唐僧和悟空叫醒了八戒和悟净。师徒四人从老陈的家里悄悄地出来，朝东边走去。天很黑，但是满月把路照得很亮。<br>
            突然，雷音寺的门将出现了。<br>
            “祝贺你们！”&nbsp;门将说，
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The monk and Wukong woke up Bajie and Wujing. The group sneaked out of Laochen's house and headed east. It was dark, but the light from the full moon lit up the road.<br>
            Suddenly the guard from the Thunderclap Monastery appeared.<br>
            "Congratulations!" said the guard.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们已经经历了九九八十一难。”&nbsp;<br>
            “咻。”&nbsp;唐僧安心地吐了口气。“我终于能成佛了。”&nbsp;<br>
            门将念了一个咒语。师徒四人又朝东边飞去。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You have faced 81 challenges."<br>
            "Whew." The monk sighed with relief. "I will become a buddha at last."<br>
            The guard recited a spell. Once again the travelers flew toward the east.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;师徒四人飞到了大唐上空。<br>
            唐僧流下了幸福的泪水。“我看到皇帝的宫殿了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “你们去送真经吧，我在这里等着你们。”&nbsp;门将说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The travelers flew through the sky over the Tang Empire.<br>
            Tears of happiness rolled down the Tang Monk's cheeks. "I see the emperor's palace!"<br>
            "Go deliver the True Scriptures. I will wait here," said the guard.

            唐僧一行人落在地上，进入宫殿。<br>
            皇帝的眼睛亮了。“御弟！”&nbsp;他抱住了唐僧。“数年来，我都在想是否还能再见到你。你真的取到真经了？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk and his companions went down to Earth and entered the palace.<br>
            The emperor's eyes lit up. "My brother!" He embraced the monk. "For many years I wondered if I'd ever see you again. Did you get the True Scriptures?"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;唐僧说，“但是，请原谅我。取经时间比预想的要长。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你不必道歉。”&nbsp;皇帝说。然后，他注意到唐僧的徒弟们。“他们是谁？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes," said the monk. "But please forgive me. The journey took much longer than I expected."<br>
            "There's no need to apologize," said the emperor. Then he noticed the monk's companions. "Who are they?"

            悟空走上前。“我是美猴王孙悟空。曾经打败过整个天兵天将。”&nbsp;<br>
            “还有我是猪八戒。”&nbsp;八戒说。<br>
            “我叫沙悟净。”&nbsp;紫色和尚说。<br>
            “西天取经的路上，是他们保护我的。”&nbsp;唐僧解释道，

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong stepped forward. "I am Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. I once defeated Heaven's entire army."<br>
            "And I am Zhu Bajie," said Bajie.<br>
            "My name is Sha Wujing," said the purple spirit.<br>
            "They protected me during the journey," the monk explained.

            “没有他们，我是到不了西天的。”&nbsp;<br>
            皇帝低头向悟空他们行礼。<br>
            悟空笑了。“您不必行礼。能帮助师父，我们很高兴。嗯…...我和悟净是这样想。八戒一直抱怨来着。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒哼了一声。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I couldn't have reached the Western Paradise without them."<br>
            The emperor bowed to Wukong and the others.<br>
            Wukong laughed. "You don't need to bow. We were happy to help. Well, Wujing and I were. Bajie complained the entire time."<br>
            Bajie snorted.

            那天晚上，皇帝举行了盛宴。皇帝问了唐僧很多关于西天取经的问题。他听了唐僧的故事，非常吃惊。<br>
            “我要盖一座壮观的塔。”&nbsp;皇帝说，“把真经放到那里，安全地保管。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            There was a huge feast that night. The emperor asked the monk many questions about the journey. He listened in amazement to the monk's stories.<br>
            "I will build a magnificent pagoda," said the emperor. "The True Scriptures will be kept safe inside it."<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他把手放在唐僧的肩膀上。“人们会永远记住你的，是你这位勇敢的和尚去西天取回了真经。托你的福，我们百姓不用再受苦了。”&nbsp;<br>
            吃完饭后，皇帝让唐僧念真经。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He put his hand on the monk's shoulder. "You will always be remembered as the brave monk who traveled to the West. Because of you, our people won't have to suffer anymore."<br>
            After the food was eaten, the emperor asked the monk to read from the scriptures.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            唐僧笑了。“我愿意给您念真经！”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧坐在一个台子上。台子上的三个篮子里放有真经。他打开一个卷轴。<br>
            突然，金光充满整个屋子。师徒四人升到了空中。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Tang Monk smiled. "I would be happy to read from them."<br>
            The monk sat on a platform, where the scriptures had been placed in baskets. He unrolled a scroll.<br>
            Suddenly light filled the room. The Tang Monk and his companions rose into the sky.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们得回雷音寺了。”&nbsp;门将说，“佛祖在等你们。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好，走吧。”&nbsp;唐僧说。<br>
            很快，师徒四人就又出现在佛祖面前，他们低头行礼。其他的佛和菩萨站在佛祖身后。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We should return to the Thunderclap Monastery," said the guard. "Buddha is waiting for you."<br>
            "Yes, let's go," said the monk.<br>
            The travelers were soon bowing before Buddha again. Other buddhas and bodhisattvas stood behind him.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            佛祖先跟马说：“你驮着唐僧来西天，你被宽恕了。你现在将成为天上的八部天龙。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Buddha addressed the horse first. "You carried the Tang Monk on the journey and earned forgiveness for your crimes. You will now be a golden dragon in Heaven."<br>
            Light flashed as a large golden dragon soared into the sky.

            “悟净。”&nbsp;佛祖说，“你也被宽恕了。你现在将成为金身罗汉。”&nbsp;<br>

            “你也被宽恕了，八戒。”&nbsp;佛祖说，

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wujing," said Buddha. "You too have earned forgiveness for your past crimes. You will now be a golden deity."<br>
            Wujing's body turned gold. The spirit bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."<br>
            "You have earned forgiveness, Bajie," said Buddha.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你将成为净坛使者，来管理佛教祭坛。这个职位非常重要。”&nbsp;<br>
            八戒低头行礼。“谢谢，佛祖。”&nbsp;<br>
            接下来，佛祖看向唐僧。“托你的福，东方百姓不会再受苦了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You will be Janitor of the Altars—an important deity who looks after Buddhist altars."<br>
            Bajie bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."<br>
            Buddha next turned to the Tang Monk. "Because of you, the people in the East will never have to suffer again.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            你完成了一件别人无法做到的事情。现在你成佛了。”&nbsp;<br>
            唐僧低头向佛祖行礼，他的头上出现了一个光圈。<br>
            “谢谢，佛祖。”&nbsp;唐僧说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You have done something that no other person could do. You are now a buddha."<br>
            Light glowed around the monk, who bowed before Buddha. <br>
            "Thank you, Buddha," said the monk.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，佛祖看向悟空。“还有你，悟空。”&nbsp;他开始说，“很久以前，你做了坏事。但是那以后，你用自己的无边法力做了很多好事。你现在也成佛了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally Buddha turned to Wukong. "And you, Wukong," he began. "A long time ago, you had committed terrible crimes. But since then you have used your tremendous powers to do good deeds. You too are now a buddha."
        </div>
    </div>

            悟空低头行礼。“谢谢，佛祖。”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦？”&nbsp;悟空突然觉得自己的头有点不一样了，“头箍消失了！”&nbsp;<br>
            佛祖笑了。“你再也不需要它了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Wukong bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."<br>
            "Hey . . ." Wukong suddenly noticed that his head felt different. "The headband is gone!"<br>
            Buddha smiled. "You don't need it anymore."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            悟空和唐僧非常高兴，和其他佛、菩萨站到了一起。从那以后，他们一直在西天生活。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Filled with joy, Wukong and the Tang Monk joined the other buddhas and bodhisattvas. They have been in the Western Paradise ever since.
