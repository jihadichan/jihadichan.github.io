        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一个阳光灿烂的夏日午后，爱丽丝坐在河边。她的姐姐夏洛特坐在她身边，开心地看着书。爱丽丝觉得很无聊，她瞥了瞥姐姐的书。<br>
            &nbsp;“要是一本书里没有图画，那还有什么意思呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On a golden summer afternoon, Alice sat by the river. Her older sister Charlotte sat beside her, happily reading a book. Feeling bored, Alice glanced at her sister's book.<br>
            "What's the point of a book without pictures?" Alice asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            夏洛特忙着看书，没有回答她。爱丽丝叹了口气，她在考虑要不要做一个雏菊花环。但是，那就需要她去摘雏菊。可这炎热的天气让爱丽丝一点儿都不想动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Charlotte was too busy reading to reply. Alice gave a tired sigh and thought about making a daisy chain. However, that would require getting up to pick the daisies. And the hot day was making Alice feel lazy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，一只兔子从女孩儿们的身边跑过。他是白色的，还穿着彩色的背心。“天啊！天啊！”&nbsp;他大喊，“我要迟到了！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝非常困，甚至没有意识到动物会说话是一件奇怪的事情。但是，白兔竟然从背心口袋里拿出了一只手表。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly, a rabbit ran past the girls. He was white and wore a colorful vest. "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he cried. "I'm going to be late!"<br>
            Alice was so sleepy that she didn't even think a talking animal was strange. But then the White Rabbit pulled a watch from his vest pocket.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我从来没有见过兔子穿背心，”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“更不可能戴手表。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝跳起来，去追白兔，白兔跳进了树篱旁边的一个大洞里。爱丽丝紧紧地跟着他，并没有想以后要怎么出去。突然，她开始往下掉！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I have never seen rabbits wearing vests," Alice said to herself. "And there is no way that they carry watches."<br>
            Alice jumped up and ran after the White Rabbit, and near a hedge he popped down a large rabbit hole. Alice followed right after him, not thinking about how she'd get out. Suddenly, she was falling!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “救命啊！”&nbsp;爱丽丝大喊。她感觉自己好像掉进了一个大井里。<br>
            下面太黑了，什么都看不到。爱丽丝看了看周围，兔子洞的四周全是橱柜和架子，墙上贴着地图和各种图片。<br>
            爱丽丝从架子上拿了一个写着橘子酱的罐子。当她看到罐子里什么也没有时，非常失望。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Help!" Alice cried. She felt as if she were falling down a deep well.<br>
            It was too dark to see anything below. Alice looked around; the rabbit hole was lined with cupboards and shelves, and maps and pictures decorated the walls.<br>
            Alice grabbed a jar labeled Orange Jam from one shelf. She was disappointed to discover it was empty.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “如果我把这个罐子扔下去，可能会砸死人的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她把罐子推进下一个架子里。爱丽丝继续往下掉。<br>
            “经过这次之后，我一定不会因为从楼梯上滚下来生气了。不对，就连从屋顶上掉下来我也不会抱怨了！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝不断地往下掉。究竟什么时候才会停止呢？&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "If I drop this jar, it might kill somebody below," Alice said. She slipped it onto the next shelf she passed. Alice continued to fall.<br>
            "After this, I'll never get upset about just falling down some stairs. Why, I won't even complain if I fall off the roof!"<br>
            Alice kept falling down. When would this fall end?
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我掉了多少英里了呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我一定快到地球中心了。如果我穿过了地球呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝会掉到哪里去呢？她试着回忆自己在地理课上学到的知识。“我只需要问我看到的第一个人，我会问‘请问这里是新西兰还是澳大利亚？’。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How many miles have I fallen by now?" Alice said. "I must be getting near the center of the earth. What if I fall right through the earth?"<br>
            Where would Alice end up? She tried to remember what she learned from her geography lessons. "I'll just have to ask the first person I meet. I'll say, 'Is this New Zealand or Australia?'"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝沉默了一会，随后她想起了自己的猫&nbsp;“戴娜”&nbsp;。“希望今晚有人记得喂它。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“哦，戴娜，你要是在这里该多好！这里没有老鼠，但是你也许可以抓到蝙蝠。猫吃蝙蝠吗？还是蝙蝠吃猫？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was silent for a while, but then she started thinking about her cat Dinah. "I hope someone remembers to feed it tonight," Alice said. "Oh, Dinah, I wish you were here! There aren't any mice, but you might catch a bat. Do cats eat bats? Do bats eat cats?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝不知道问题的答案。她觉得非常非常累。她开始做梦，梦到她正牵着戴娜的手散步。<br>
            砰！突然，爱丽丝掉在了一堆树枝和干树叶上。她并没有受伤，所以她马上跳了起来。那只白兔跑进了前方长长的走廊里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice didn't know the answer to the questions. And she was feeling so, so tired. She was beginning to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah.<br>
            Thump! Suddenly Alice landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. She wasn't hurt, so she jumped right up. The White Rabbit was hurrying down a long passage ahead.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我得赶上那只兔子！”&nbsp;爱丽丝飞快地追了过去。<br>
            “哎呀，我的耳朵和胡子呀！现在太晚了！”&nbsp;白兔边拐弯边说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'd better catch up with that rabbit!" Alice ran as fast as she could.<br>
            "Oh, my ears and whiskers! It's getting very late!" the White Rabbit said as he turned a corner.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝也赶到拐角，但是白兔已经不见了。她发现自己在一个又长又低的大厅里，&nbsp;两边都是小门。天花板上的灯发出微弱的光，照着整个大厅。<br>
            “那只白兔肯定是进了其中一扇门。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice turned the corner too, but the White Rabbit had disappeared. She was now in a long, low hall with doors lining both walls. Lamps hanging from the ceiling dimly illuminated the hall.<br>
            "The White Rabbit must have gone through one of these doors," Alice said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她走到大厅的一边，试着打开每一扇门，门全都锁住了。她走到大厅的另一边，那些门也都锁住了。爱丽丝伤心地站在大厅中间。<br>
            “我该怎么出去呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝伤心地说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She walked down one side of the hall, tried every door, and they were all locked. She walked up the other side of the hall, and those doors were locked too. Alice stood sadly in the middle of the hall.<br>
            "How will I ever get out of here?" she cried.
        </div>
    </div>

<div class="desc">
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝看了看昏暗的大厅，她发现了一个玻璃桌，桌子上有一把小小的金钥匙。<br>
            “不知道这把钥匙能不能打开其中一扇门。”&nbsp;爱丽丝拿起钥匙说。<br>
            她试着用钥匙开每一扇门，钥匙太小了，但爱丽丝并没有放弃。她重新试了一遍。这次，她发现了一个小帘子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Looking around the dimly lit hall, Alice spotted a glass table, and on top of it lay a tiny gold key.<br>
            "I wonder if this will unlock a door," Alice said as she picked up the key.<br>
            She tried the key in every door on both sides of the hall. It was too small, but Alice didn't give up. She tried again. This time, she discovered a small curtain.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这里之前没有这个小帘子啊！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她拉开帘子。<br>
            帘子后面是一扇大约15英寸高的门。小小的金钥匙刚好可以插进去！<br>
            爱丽丝打开门，跪在地上，她看到一个美丽的花园。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This wasn't here before!" Alice said. She pulled aside the curtain.<br>
            Behind it was a door about 15 inches high. And the tiny gold key fit perfectly! <br>
            Alice opened the door and knelt down. She peered through a small passage to a beautiful garden.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哇！这是我见过的最美的花园！”&nbsp;她说，“看看那些花，还有那个喷泉！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝想要去花园里玩儿，但是她太大了。她希望能把自己变小，这样就可以走进这扇门了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wow! That's the loveliest garden I've ever seen!" she said. "Look at those flowers and that fountain!"<br>
            Alice wanted to wander through the garden, but she was too big. She wished she could make herself small so that she could walk through the door.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我一定可以的，但是该怎么办呢？”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            之前发生的事情都非常奇怪，所以一切皆有可能。“在这个小门旁边等也没有什么意义。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。她再次走回桌子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm sure I could, but what should I do?" she said.<br>
            So many strange things had already happened that nothing seemed impossible. "There is no point in waiting by the little door," Alice thought. She headed back to the table.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “说不定那里有可以把我变小的东西。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            爱丽丝找到一个瓶子。她确定之前并没有这个瓶子。瓶子上有一个标签，标签上用又大又漂亮的字写着&nbsp;“喝我”&nbsp;。<br>
            “我才不要喝什么奇怪的饮料呢！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“有可能是毒药！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Maybe there will be something that will make me become smaller," Alice said.<br>
            Alice found a bottle. She was sure that it had not been there before. There was a paper label on the bottle that said, "Drink Me," in large, beautiful letters.<br>
            "I'm not going to drink some strange drink!" Alice said. "That could be poison!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝仔细地看了看标签，但是标签上并没有提到这个饮料有毒。于是，她决定尝一口。<br>
            “嗯。真好喝！”&nbsp;爱丽丝舔了舔嘴唇，“像樱桃馅饼、菠萝、烤火鸡和黄油吐司混合起来的味道。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice examined the label carefully, but there was no mention of poison. So she decided to take a sip.<br>
            "Mmm. That's delicious." Alice licked her lips. "It's like a mixture of cherry tart, pineapple, roast turkey, and buttered toast."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝非常喜欢这个饮料，所以很快就全喝掉了。奇怪的事情发生了。<br>
            “感觉真奇怪。”&nbsp;爱丽丝看看自己，“我好像在变小。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice liked the liquid so much that she soon finished the whole bottle. And then something strange began to happen.<br>
            "What an odd feeling." Alice looked around her. "I seem to be shrinking."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝现在只有十英寸高，但是她并不难过，她现在可以穿过那个小门了。爱丽丝非常渴望走进花园里，但她等了一会儿。<br>
            “我要确认一下是不是不会再变小了。”&nbsp;她说，“如果我继续变小，最后什么都不剩该怎么办呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And indeed Alice was only ten inches high, but she was not upset. She was now able to walk through the little door. Alice was eager to enter the garden, but she waited for a while.<br>
            "I want to be sure I've finished shrinking," she said. "What if I keep shrinking until there's nothing left of me?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            幸运的是，她并没有再变小。于是，爱丽丝走到小门前。不可思议的是，小门已经重新关上了。爱丽丝伸手去口袋里摸钥匙。<br>
            “不好了！我把钥匙忘在桌子上了！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝快速跑回桌子。她可以很清楚地看到钥匙，但是她没有办法拿到它。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Fortunately she didn't keep shrinking. So she walked over to the little door. The door had mysteriously closed again. Alice reached in her pocket for the key.<br>
            "Oh no! I left the key on the table!"<br>
            Alice raced back to the table. She could see the key quite clearly through the glass. But there was no way she could reach it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝试着从一条玻璃桌腿爬上去，但是她滑到了地板上，桌腿太滑了！她还是继续尝试，直到筋疲力尽。<br>
            爱丽丝坐在地上大哭了起来，但她只哭了一小会儿。“哭是没有用的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝对自己说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Trying to climb one of the glass legs, Alice slid back to the floor. The leg was so slippery! Still, she kept trying until she was exhausted.<br>
            Alice sat down and cried, but that only lasted for a minute. "Crying won't help you," Alice said to herself.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她擦了擦眼泪。这时，桌子下面出现了一个玻璃盒子！盒子里面有一个蛋糕，上面用葡萄干拼出了&nbsp;“吃我”&nbsp;的字样。<br>
            “如果这个蛋糕可以让我变大，我就可以拿到钥匙。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“如果让我变小，我就可以从门底爬过去。不管怎样，我都可以进入花园。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She wiped her eyes. Now there was a glass box under the table! Inside was a cake with the words "Eat Me" spelled out in raisins.<br>
            "If this cake makes me grow larger, I can reach the key," Alice said. "If I grow smaller, I can creep under the door. Either way I'll get into that garden."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝咬了一口蛋糕，但什么都没有发生。她很失望，因为她本来期待会有奇怪的事情发生。<br>
            “这真是个没用的蛋糕。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，但她还是把整个蛋糕都吃掉了。<br>
            这时，她开始变大了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice took a bite, and nothing happened. She was very disappointed because she now expected strange things to occur.<br>
            "This is a useless cake," Alice said. But she ate it all anyway.<br>
            And then she began to grow.
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真是越来越奇怪了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝一边变大一边说。<br>
            当她往下看时，她的脚已经看不见了。<br>
            “再见，我的脚！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“不知道谁可以帮你们穿上鞋子和袜子。我将会离你们越来越远，再也帮不到你们了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Things are getting stranger and stranger!" Alice said as she kept growing. <br>
            When she looked down, her feet were almost out of sight.<br>
            "Good-bye, feet!" Alice said. "I wonder who will put on your shoes and socks. I will be farther and farther away and not able to help you."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            接着，她担心了起来。如果她的脚不听话了怎么办？“我一定要对它们好一点。每年圣诞节我都要给它们一双新靴子，但是给我自己的脚送礼物好像很奇怪呢！天啊，我在胡说八道什么。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then she began to worry. What if her feet wouldn't listen to her? "I must be nice to them. I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas. But it will seem strange to send presents to my own feet! Oh dear, I am talking nonsense."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，她的头碰到了大厅的天花板。爱丽丝继续变大，她已经超过了九英尺，但她并不伤心。现在，她可以很容易地够到玻璃桌上的金钥匙了。<br>
            爱丽丝拿起钥匙，迅速打开了花园的门。可怜的爱丽丝，她太大了。如果她侧身躺下来，就可以用一只眼睛看到花园里面。至于进入花园，那就非常困难了。爱丽丝又哭了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then her head hit the hall ceiling. Alice kept growing and she was more than nine feet tall, but she wasn't upset. Now she was big enough to reach the gold key on the glass table.<br>
            Alice picked up the key and hurried to the garden door. Poor Alice! She was so big. If she lay on her side, she could look into the garden with one eye. As for getting into the garden, that was harder than ever. Alice started to cry again.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝试图责备自己，但却哭得更凶了。她流了一大堆眼泪，眼泪变成一个大水池，有四英寸深，淹了半个大厅。<br>
            过了一会儿，爱丽丝听到远处传来脚步声。她赶快擦干眼泪，看看是谁来了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She tried scolding herself, but that made her cry harder. Alice cried buckets of tears. A large pool formed around her, four inches deep and spreading halfway down the hall.<br>
            After a while Alice heard footsteps in the distance. She quickly wiped her eyes to see who was coming.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            是那只白兔。他穿着外套，手里拿着白手套和扇子。<br>
            他在黑暗的大厅里边跑边自言自语：“公爵夫人！公爵夫人！如果我迟到了，她一定会非常生气的！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was the White Rabbit. He was wearing a jacket and carrying white gloves and a fan.<br>
            He trotted through the dark hall, muttering to himself. "The Duchess! The Duchess! She'll be very angry if I'm late!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝现在已经非常绝望了。她愿意向任何人寻求帮助，即使是一只会说话的兔子。<br>
            她耐心地等着。直到兔子跑近，她才用轻柔的声音说：“不好意思……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was feeling very desperate by now. She was willing to ask for help from anyone, even a talking rabbit.<br>
            She waited patiently until the White Rabbit was nearby before speaking in a quiet, timid voice. "Please, sir . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            白兔吓了一大跳，扔掉了手里的手套和扇子，快速地跑进黑暗中。爱丽丝捡起兔子的东西。因为大厅很热，爱丽丝开始用扇子扇风。<br>
            “今天的每一件事情都很奇怪。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“昨天一切都还很正常。这一夜之间我是怎么变成这样的？今天早上我确实感觉有一点儿不同。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Startled, the White Rabbit dropped his gloves and fan, and ran as fast as he could into the darkness. Alice picked up the rabbit's things. She began to fan herself because the hall was very hot.<br>
            "How strange everything is today," Alice said. "Yesterday everything was normal. How did I change overnight? I almost think I did feel a little different this morning."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝继续扇扇子。“也许我变成了另外一个人。”&nbsp;她想起了她的朋友们。她没有变成他们中的任何一个。<br>
            爱丽丝又大哭了起来。“要是夏洛特能看到这个兔子洞，然后大喊我的名字该多好！我实在不想再一个人待在这里了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice continued to fan herself. "Maybe I've been changed into another person." She thought about all her friends. She hadn't been changed into any of them.<br>
            Alice burst into tears again. "I wish Charlotte would look down this rabbit hole and call my name! I'm so tired of being here all alone!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她边说边看了一下自己的手。她的一只手居然已经戴上了兔子的手套。“我是怎么戴上这只手套的呢？我一定又变小了！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝跑回桌子，站在桌子旁边作对比。她觉得自己差不多有两英尺高。而且，她还在不断地变小！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As she said this, she looked at her hands. She saw that she'd put on one of the White Rabbit's gloves. "How did I put on this glove? I must be shrinking again!"<br>
            Alice ran back to the table and stood next to it for comparison. She thought that she was about two feet high. And she was continuing to shrink!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “一定是扇子。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。为了不让自己小到消失，她扔掉了扇子。&nbsp;“真险啊！现在可以去花园了！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝跑到花园门前，但是门又关上了。爱丽丝没有钥匙。她在大厅里找了找，发现钥匙在玻璃桌上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It must be the fan," Alice said. To save herself from completely disappearing, she dropped the fan. "That was a narrow escape! And now for the garden!"<br>
            Alice ran back to the garden door, but it was locked again. Alice didn't have the key. She searched the hall and found the key on the glass table.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “钥匙是怎么到那里去的呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝绝望地看着它，“现在比之前还要糟糕。因为我从来没有变得这么小过！”&nbsp;<br>
            突然，爱丽丝的脚滑了一下。她掉进了一滩盐水里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How did the key get here?" Alice looked up at it in despair. "Things are worse than ever. It's because I've never been this small before!"<br>
            Suddenly her foot slipped. Alice fell up to her chin in salt water.

            爱丽丝掉进盐水里的时候，她以为自己掉进了海里。但是，她很快就发现，她是在自己的泪池里&nbsp;。<br>
            “在我变大的时候，我竟然流了这么多眼泪。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她游来游去，试着找陆地。“要是我不那么爱哭就好了。作为惩罚，我会被自己的眼泪淹死。那就真的是一件非常奇怪的事情了，但是今天所有的事情都非常奇怪。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When she fell into the salt water, Alice thought she had fallen into the sea. But she soon realized she was in a pool of her own tears.<br>
            "I cried all these tears when I was big," Alice said. She swam about, trying to find her way to dry land. "I wish I hadn't cried so much. I'll be punished for that by drowning in my own tears. That will be strange indeed, but everything is strange today."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，爱丽丝听到水花的声音。一开始，她觉得那可能是海象或者河马，但她想到了自己的大小。这个动物一定也很小。<br>
            爱丽丝朝着声音的方向游去。很快，她就看到了一只老鼠，他也掉进了池里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then Alice heard something splashing. At first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippo. But then she remembered how small she was. The creature must be small too.<br>
            Alice swam toward the sound. Soon she spotted a mouse, which had also fallen into the pool.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “跟这只动物说话有意义吗？”&nbsp;爱丽丝想，“他听得懂吗？这里每件事都很奇怪，说不定他还会说话呢！”&nbsp;爱丽丝决定试一试。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Is there any point in speaking to this creature?" Alice thought. "Can he even understand me? Everything is so strange down here that he probably can talk." She decided to take a chance.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嘿，老鼠！”&nbsp;爱丽丝大声喊，“你知道怎么游出这个池吗？我已经游得很累了。嘿，老鼠！”&nbsp;<br>
            老鼠似乎感兴趣地看了一眼爱丽丝，还对她眨了眨眼，但什么都没说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, Mouse!" Alice called. "Do you know the way out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming. Oh, Mouse!"<br>
            The Mouse looked at Alice with some interest. He also seemed to wink at her but said nothing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯……可能他不懂英文。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语，“他可能是从法国来的。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝决定试一试法语。不过，她只记得法语语法课本里的第一句话。糟糕的是，那句话是&nbsp;“我的猫在哪里？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hmm. Perhaps he doesn't understand English," Alice said to herself. "Maybe he's from France."<br>
            Alice decided to try speaking some French. All she could think of was the first sentence in her French grammar book. Unfortunately, that sentence was "Where is my cat?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            老鼠突然跳出水面，吓得发抖。<br>
            “对不起！”&nbsp;爱丽丝马上说，“我忘记老鼠不喜欢猫了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不喜欢猫？”&nbsp;老鼠大喊，“如果你是我，你会喜欢猫吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and quivered with fright.<br>
            "I'm so sorry!" Alice said quickly. "I forgot that mice dislike cats."<br>
            "Dislike cats?" the Mouse cried. "If you were me, would you like cats?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，也许不会吧！但是请不要生气。”&nbsp;爱丽丝冷静地说。她很开心老鼠会说英文。“要是你能见见我的猫戴娜就好了。我觉得如果你见到她，你会开始喜欢猫的。&nbsp;戴娜是一只可爱又安静的猫。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, perhaps not, but don't be angry with me," Alice said calmly. She was glad that the Mouse spoke English. "I wish that I could show you my cat, Dinah. I think you'd learn to like cats if you met her. Dinah is such a dear, quiet thing."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            老鼠什么也没说。<br>
            爱丽丝一边为老鼠描述戴娜，一边在池里慢慢地游着。“戴娜躺在火炉旁边，发出呼噜声。她舔爪子，洗脸。当你抚摸她的时候，又舒服又柔软。她最擅长抓老鼠……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mouse said nothing.<br>
            Alice described Dinah for the Mouse as she swam lazily around the pool. "Dinah lies by the fire, purring so nicely. She licks her paws and washes her face. She's such a nice, soft thing to pet. And she's the best at catching mice . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            老鼠气得发抖。爱丽丝觉得自己一定是冒犯了他。“对不起。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我们再也不提关于戴娜的事了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们？”&nbsp;老鼠尖叫道，“说的好像我会提这种事一样！我们家族一直都很讨厌猫。不要再让我听到‘猫’这个词了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mouse was shaking with anger, and Alice was sure she had offended him. "I beg your pardon," Alice said. "We won't talk about Dinah anymore."<br>
            "We!" the Mouse squeaked. "As if I would talk about such a thing! Our family has always hated cats. Don't let me hear the word 'cat' again."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。&nbsp;她想了一会儿。“那狗呢？你喜欢狗吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            老鼠没有回答。于是爱丽丝继续说：“我们家旁边的农场有一只很不错的狗。当你扔东西时，它会叼回来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "All right," Alice said. She thought for a while. "How about dogs? Are you fond of dogs?"<br>
            The Mouse did not reply, so Alice went on eagerly. "There's such a nice dog on the farm near our house. It fetches things when you throw them.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            它会坐起来，求主人给它晚餐吃。农夫说它很值钱，因为它非常擅长抓老鼠，而且……"<br>
            老鼠开始飞快地从爱丽丝身边游走。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And it sits up and begs for its dinner. The farmer says it's worth a lot of money. That's because it's so good at catching rats, and . . ."<br>
            The Mouse started swimming away from Alice as fast as he could.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不好了，我好像又让他不开心了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝伤心地说。她决定再试着和老鼠接近一次。<br>
            “亲爱的老鼠！”&nbsp;爱丽丝温柔地叫他，“如果你回来，我保证，我们不会再说狗或者猫了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, no, I'm afraid I've hurt his feelings again," Alice said in a sad voice. She decided to try one more time to make friends with the Mouse.<br>
            "Mouse, dear!" Alice called softly. "If you come back, I promise we won't talk about dogs or cats anymore."

            老鼠听到了爱丽丝的话。他转过身来，慢慢地游向她。他用颤抖的声音说：“我们游到岸边吧！你听了我的故事以后，就会明白为什么我讨厌猫和狗了。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝很开心，她可以从盐水里出来了。池里渐渐有了许多鸟。爱丽丝在前面带路。大家都游到了岸上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mouse heard Alice. He turned around and swam slowly toward her. With a trembling voice, he said, "Let's swim to shore. After I tell you my story, you'll understand why I hate cats and dogs."<br>
            Alice was happy to get out of the salt water. The pool was getting crowded with birds. Alice led the way. Everyone swam to shore.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们一起聚在池边，看上去很别扭。大家都觉得身上湿湿的，很不舒服，主要问题就是应该怎么变干。动物们讨论了起来，很快爱丽丝也加入了。她再也不对自己可以和动物们交谈感到惊讶了。她还和一只鹦鹉争论了很久。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was an odd-looking group that gathered at the edge of the pool. Everyone was dripping wet and uncomfortable. The main question was how to get dry again. The creatures started to discuss this, and Alice soon joined in. She wasn't surprised anymore that she could talk to birds and animals. She had a long argument with the Parrot.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们需要毛巾，”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“很多的毛巾，那是变干的最快方法。”&nbsp;<br>
            “大错特错。”&nbsp;鹦鹉说，“我们鸟从来不用毛巾。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那你有更好的想法吗？”&nbsp;爱丽丝不想再争论了。<br>
            “我比你大，所以我知道的也比你多。”&nbsp;鹦鹉回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We need towels," Alice finally said. "Lots and lots of towels. That's the fastest way to dry off."<br>
            "Completely wrong," the Parrot said. "We birds never use towels."<br>
            "Do you have a better idea?" Alice was getting tired of arguing about towels.<br>
            "I'm older than you are, so I know more than you do," the Parrot replied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真的吗？你到底多大？”&nbsp;<br>
            但是，鹦鹉不愿意告诉她自己的年龄。争论就这样结束了。<br>
            老鼠站出来说话了。“大家请坐下。在你们变干的这段时间里，我来给大家讲一讲我的故事。我的家族和猫有着一段又长又悲伤的历史……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Really, Parrot? How old are you anyway?"<br>
            But the Parrot refused to reveal her age, so that was the end of the argument.<br>
            The Mouse spoke up. "Sit down, everyone, and I'll tell you my story while you dry. My family has a long, sad history with cats . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好冷。”&nbsp;一只鸭子颤抖着说。<br>
            “不好意思。”&nbsp;老鼠说，“你刚才说什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            还没等鸭子回答，一只渡渡鸟就说：“我知道怎么变干。我们来比赛吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Cold," the Duck said with a shiver.<br>
            "I beg your pardon," the Mouse said. "What did you say?"<br>
            Before the Duck could reply, the Dodo spoke up. "I know how to get dry. We'll have a race!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝看了看大厅。“我们在哪里比赛呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            渡渡鸟已经画了一个圆圈。“有没有准确的路线并不重要。”&nbsp;他画完说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice looked around the hall. "Where will we race?"<br>
            The Dodo was already marking off a circle. "Whether or not there is an exact course doesn't matter," he said when he finished.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这是爱丽丝见过的最奇怪的比赛。因为渡渡鸟允许大家从不一样的起点出发，所以没有起跑线。他也没有说&nbsp;“各就各位，预备，跑！”&nbsp;他只是让大家爱什么时候开始就什么时候开始。<br>
            当大家跑了三十分钟之后，渡渡鸟喊道：“比赛结束！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was the strangest race that Alice had ever seen. The Dodo let everyone start in different spots, so there was no starting line. And he didn't say, "On your mark, get set, go!" He just let everyone start whenever they liked.<br>
            When they'd been running for thirty minutes, the Dodo called out, "The race is over!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            现在大家身上都干了，也开心了。鸟儿们围着渡渡鸟。“谁赢了呢？”&nbsp;其中一只问。<br>
            这是一个很难回答的问题。渡渡鸟想了很久。最后他说：“大家都赢了。每个人都能得到奖品！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone was now dry and happy. The birds gathered around the Dodo. "But who is the winner?" one asked.<br>
            This was a puzzling question, which the Dodo thought about for a long time. At last he said, "Everybody has won, and all must have prizes!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但是谁给我们奖品？”&nbsp;鸭子问。<br>
            “当然是她！”&nbsp;渡渡鸟指着爱丽丝说。大家围着爱丽丝大喊：“奖品！奖品！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝不知道该怎么办。她把手伸进口袋里，找到了一盒糖。还好糖还是干的，而且足够分给大家。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But who will give out the prizes?" a duck asked.<br>
            "She will, of course!" The Dodo pointed to Alice. Everyone crowded around her, shouting, "Prizes! Prizes!"<br>
            Alice had no idea what to do. But reaching into her pocket, she found a box of candies. Luckily, they'd stayed dry, and she had enough to give everyone one piece.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是，没有剩下的糖给她自己。<br>
            “可是你也得得到奖品啊！”&nbsp;老鼠坚持说。<br>
            “当然了。”&nbsp;渡渡鸟回答。他把头转向爱丽丝。“你口袋里还有什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            However, there wasn't one left for herself.<br>
            "But you must have a prize!" the Mouse insisted.<br>
            "Of course," the Dodo replied. He turned to Alice. "What else do you have in your pocket?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “只有一个顶针。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “给我。”&nbsp;渡渡鸟命令她说。<br>
            大家又向爱丽丝围了过来。渡渡鸟正式地把顶针给了她。接着，他发表了一小段话。大家都欢呼起来。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Only a thimble," Alice said.<br>
            "Hand it over," the Dodo commanded her.<br>
            Everyone crowded around Alice once again as the Dodo solemnly awarded her the thimble. Then he gave a short speech. Everyone cheered.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝觉得很好笑。但是，鸟儿们都非常严肃，所以她也不敢笑出来。她只是鞠了个躬。她心想，兔子洞里的动物们真的好奇怪呀！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice thought the whole thing was silly. But the birds looked so serious that she didn't dare laugh. She simply bowed. "Creatures in the rabbit hole are so strange!" she thought.

            奖品发完后，就是吃的时间了。爱丽丝当然没有吃她的顶针，但是动物们吃了他们的糖。大一点的鸟儿们抱怨糖太小了，他们都没有尝到味道。小一点的鸟儿们因为糖太大而被呛到。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After the prizes were given out, it was time to eat them. Alice did not eat her thimble, of course, but the other creatures ate their candy. The large birds complained that the candy was so small, they couldn't taste it. The small birds choked on their candy because it was so large.

            过了一会儿，大家都安静下来了。动物们坐成一个圆圈，求老鼠讲他的故事。<br>
            “你答应过要把你的故事告诉我们。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“还有你讨厌M和G的原因。”&nbsp;她没有说&nbsp;“猫和狗”&nbsp;。她不想再让老鼠生气了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After a while, everyone settled down. The creatures sat in a circle and begged the Mouse to tell them his story.<br>
            "You promised to tell us your story," Alice said. "And why you hate M and G." She didn't say "cats and dogs." She didn't want to upset the Mouse again.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我又长又悲伤的......”&nbsp;老鼠说。<br>
            爱丽丝仔细看了看老鼠的身体。“你的尾巴是很长，但我不明白为什么很悲伤。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不是说我的尾巴，”&nbsp;老鼠不耐烦地说，“我说的是我的故事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My tale is long and sad . . . " the Mouse began.<br>
            Alice studied the mouse's body. "You definitely have a long tail, but I don't understand why it's sad."<br>
            "No, not my tail," the Mouse said impatiently. "I was talking about my tale."

            老鼠继续讲故事。爱丽丝却在想其它的事情。<br>
            “现在你明白我不喜欢猫的原因了吗？”&nbsp;老鼠对爱丽丝说。<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;爱丽丝看着他，眨了眨眼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He went on talking. Meanwhile Alice kept thinking about other things.<br>
            "Now do you understand why I don't like cats?" the Mouse said to Alice.<br>
            "What?" Alice looked at him and blinked.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你根本没有听！”&nbsp;老鼠生气地说，“我不知道自己干嘛还要给你讲这个故事。”&nbsp;他走开了。<br>
            爱丽丝又让老鼠生气了，她觉得很伤心。“请回来再讲一次你的故事吧！”&nbsp;爱丽丝喊道，“我保证这次一定认真听！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You weren't paying attention!" the Mouse said angrily. "I don't know why I bothered telling you this story." He walked away. <br>
            Alice felt bad that she had upset him again. "Please come back and repeat your story!" she called after him. "I promise to listen to every word this time."

            “对呀，快回来吧！”&nbsp;鸟儿们也一起说。<br>

            “真可惜。”&nbsp;鹦鹉叹气说。<br>
            “要是戴娜在这里就好了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“这样她就可以帮我们抓到那只老鼠了。”&nbsp;

            "Yes, please do come back," all the others said together.<br>
            But the Mouse only shook his head and walked faster.<br>
            "What a pity." The Parrot sighed.<br>
            "I wish Dinah was here," Alice said. "She would fetch him for us."

            “请问戴娜是谁？”&nbsp;鹦鹉说。<br>
            “戴娜是我的猫，她很擅长抓老鼠。”&nbsp;爱丽丝连忙回答。她只要谈起自己的宠物，就非常开心。“&nbsp;她还很擅长抓鸟哦！”&nbsp;<br>
            鸟儿们同时开口说话，一些鸟儿迅速飞走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And who is Dinah, if I may ask?" the Parrot said.<br>
            "Dinah's my cat. She's so good at catching mice." Alice replied eagerly. She was always happy to talk about her pet. "And she is good at chasing birds too!"<br>
            All the birds started talking at once, and some hurried away as fast as they could.

            One old magpie began wrapping himself in a scarf. "I really must be going. This air is bad for my throat!"<br>

            很快就只剩爱丽丝一个人了。“要是我没有提起戴娜就好了。”&nbsp;她伤心地说，“这里好像没有人喜欢她，但我觉得她是世界上最好的猫。哦，戴娜！不知道我还能不能再见到你！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was soon left all alone. "I wish I'd never mentioned Dinah," she said sadly. "Nobody seems to like her down here, but I think she's the best cat in the world. Oh, Dinah! I wonder if I'll ever see you again!"

            可怜的爱丽丝哭了起来，她觉得又孤独又伤心。过了一小会儿，她听到了脚步声。她急忙抬起头去看，希望是老鼠改变心意回来了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Poor Alice began to cry because she felt so lonely and sad. In a little while, she heard footsteps. She looked up eagerly, hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            又是那只白兔。这次他走得很慢，紧张地四处看，看上去好像丢了东西。爱丽丝听到他在自言自语。<br>
            “公爵夫人！公爵夫人！”&nbsp;白兔一边说，一边四处寻找。“哦，我的爪子！哦，我的毛和胡须！如果我迟到了，公爵夫人会非常生气的！不知道那些东西掉在了哪里。哪儿都没有！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Once again it was the White Rabbit. This time he was walking slowly and looking anxiously about, as if he'd lost something. Alice heard him muttering to himself.<br>
            "The Duchess! The Duchess!" the White Rabbit said as he looked around. "Oh, my paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! The Duchess is going to be so angry if I'm late! I wonder where I could have dropped them. I don't see them anywhere!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝马上猜到，他一定是在找自己的手套和扇子。她开始开心地寻找那些东西，但是她也找不到。事实上，所有的东西都改变了。她现在好像在户外。有着玻璃桌和小门的大厅已经不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice guessed right away that he was looking for his gloves and fan. She happily began hunting for them, but they were nowhere to be seen. In fact, everything had changed. She seemed to be outdoors now. The great hall with the glass table and little door had disappeared.

            白兔很快就发现爱丽丝在寻找他的手套和扇子。他生气地对她喊：“玛丽·安，你在这里干什么？&nbsp;你赶快跑回家，帮我把手套和扇子拿来！快点！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The White Rabbit soon noticed Alice hunting for his gloves and fan. He called out to her in an angry voice. "Mary Ann, what are you doing here? Run home right now, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Hurry!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝知道兔子认错人了，但是，他的声音听上去非常生气，所以爱丽丝按照他指的方向跑了。她并没有解释什么。<br>
            “他很可能以为我是他的仆人。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想，“如果他发现我是谁，一定会很惊讶。但是，他现在太生气了。我还是先找到他的手套和扇子比较好。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice knew that the rabbit had mistaken her for someone else. But he sounded so angry that she ran where he was pointing. She didn't try to explain.<br>
            "He probably thinks I'm his servant," she thought. "He'll be surprised when he finds out who I am. But he's so angry right now. I'd better find his gloves and fan."

    </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝很快就跑到了一个干净的小房子前面。门上面有一个牌子，上面写着&nbsp;“白兔”&nbsp;。她赶快跑了进去，关上了大门。<br>
            “听兔子指挥的感觉真是太奇怪了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝笑着说，“很快戴娜也会吩咐我做事儿了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice soon came upon a neat little house. On the door was a sign that said W. Rabbit. She hurried inside and closed the front door.<br>
            "How strange to be sent on an errand by a rabbit." Alice laughed. "Soon Dinah will be sending me on errands too!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝走进一个房间，窗户旁有一个桌子。桌子上有一把扇子和一副白色的手套。爱丽丝把东西拿起来。她正要离开时，发现地板上有一个瓶子。<br>
            这次，瓶子上并没有写着&nbsp;“喝我”&nbsp;的标签，但是爱丽丝还是把瓶子打开了。“今天不管我吃下或喝下什么，都会有有趣的事情发生。”&nbsp;她想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice entered a room with a table near the window. On the table lay a fan and a pair of white gloves. Alice picked them up. She was about to leave when she spotted a bottle on the floor.<br>
            This time there was no label saying, Drink Me, but Alice uncorked the bottle anyway. "Whenever I eat or drink anything today, something interesting happens," she thought.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她尝了一口。“希望这个可以让我再变大起来。一直这么小，我都烦了。”&nbsp;<br>
            果然爱丽丝开始变大，而且速度还很快。还没有喝掉半瓶，她的头就碰到了天花板。她赶快放下了瓶子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She took a sip. "I hope this will make me grow again because I'm tired of being so small."<br>
            As expected, Alice started to grow and it was fast. Before she had drunk half the bottle, her head was pressing against the ceiling. She quickly put down the bottle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “够了！再大我就不能走出门了。要是我没有喝那么多就好了。”&nbsp;<br>
            但是，太晚了。爱丽丝继续变大。很快，她就只能跪在地上了。一分钟后，她需要躺在地上，把一只脚伸出烟囱。她把一只手臂伸到窗外。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's enough! If I grow bigger, I won't be able to get out the door. I wish I hadn't drunk so much."<br>
            But it was too late for that. Alice went on growing. Soon she had to kneel on the floor. In another minute she had to lie with one foot up the chimney. She stuck one arm out the window.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “没有空间了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝哭着说。<br>
            还好她没有继续变大。但是，爱丽丝被卡住了，非常不舒服。<br>
            “我自己的家要好多了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我不会一直变大变小，也不用听老鼠和兔子的吩咐。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There's no more room for me!" Alice wailed.<br>
            Luckily she stopped growing. But she was stuck and very uncomfortable.<br>
            "It was much nicer at home," Alice said. "I wasn't always changing size, and mice and rabbits weren't ordering me around.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            要是我没有跑进那个兔子洞该多好！但是……这是一个多么有趣的冒险呀！我本来以为童话故事是假的。但是现在，我就在童话故事里！也许有人会写一本关于我的书……”&nbsp;<br>
            突然，从外面传来了生气的声音。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit hole. And yet . . . and yet . . . this is quite an adventure. I used to think fairy tales weren't real. And now I seem to be in the middle of one! Maybe someone will write a book about me . . ."<br>
            Suddenly Alice heard an angry voice outside.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “玛丽·安，你在哪里？”&nbsp;白兔大喊。他试着开门，但是爱丽丝的手肘挡住了它。<br>
            “那我从窗户进去。”&nbsp;白兔说。<br>
            “你不行。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她静静地等着。当她听到白兔跑到窗户下面的时候，就试着抓住他。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Mary Ann, where are you!" the White Rabbit called. He tried to open his front door, but Alice's elbow was pressing hard against it.<br>
            "Then I'll go through a window," the White Rabbit said.<br>
            "No, you won't," Alice said. She waited quietly. When she heard the White Rabbit under the window, she tried to grab him.

            “帕特，窗户那里是什么？”&nbsp;<br>

            The White Rabbit shrieked and ran away. "Pat! Pat! Where are you?"<br>
            "Right here! Digging potatoes in the garden," a man replied.<br>
            "Pat, what's that in the window?"<br>
            The gardener looked at the house carefully. "Hmm . . . Looks like an arm to me."

            "An arm? Who's ever seen an arm that big? Take it away!"<br>

            Friends of the White Rabbit had come to help him get rid of Alice. Alice couldn't see how many creatures had gathered under the window, but she could hear them.           <br>

            "Pull the arm out the window!" another voice cried.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wish they could pull me out the window," Alice said to herself. "I don't want to stay here any longer."<br>

            "A wheelbarrow full of what?" Alice asked quietly.<br>

            No one outside said anything. Meanwhile Alice was surprised to see the pebbles turning into little cakes. "If I eat the cake, it's sure to change my size. I can't grow any larger, so I bet it'll make me smaller."

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice swallowed a cake. She was delighted to feel herself shrinking. Then she ran outside quickly. The animals immediately rushed at her. But Alice ran off as fast as she could. She was soon deep in the woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然而，爱丽丝还是觉得不安全。她在树丛里紧张地四处看。这时，她听到了狗叫声。爱丽丝抬头一看，发现一只庞大的小狗正看着她。它伸出一只爪子，想要摸她。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            However, Alice did not feel safe yet. She was searching anxiously among the trees. Then she heard something bark. Alice looked up and saw an enormous puppy staring back at her. It stretched out a paw, trying to touch her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，可怜的小狗。”&nbsp;爱丽丝温柔地说。如果她轻轻地拍拍小狗，也许它就不会吃她了。但是，虽然爱丽丝只有三英寸高，小狗还是不敢接近她。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, you poor thing," Alice said in a kind voice. Maybe if she gave it a pat, it wouldn't eat her. But the puppy wouldn't approach her even though she was only three inches tall.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            也许它是想跟她玩儿。爱丽丝捡起一根树枝。小狗兴奋地叫了起来。它奔向爱丽丝。爱丽丝赶快躲到灌木丛后面。当爱丽丝重新出现时，小狗奔向树枝，摔翻在地上。<br>
            “天啊！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“现在我这么小，跟小狗玩儿就像是跟一匹马玩儿一样！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Perhaps it wanted to play with her. Alice picked up a stick. The puppy yelped with delight. It charged at Alice. Alice ran behind a bush. When Alice appeared again, the puppy rushed at the stick and tumbled head over heels.<br>
            "Oh my!" Alice said. "I'm so small now, this is like playing games with a horse!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝担心小狗随时都可能扑到她身上。它跑来跑去，大声地叫着。最后它终于累了，躺在地上喘气。小狗伸出舌头，闭上了眼睛。<br>
            “这是逃跑的好机会。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。趁小狗休息时，爱丽丝悄悄地溜走了。她跑呀跑呀，直到再也听不到小狗的叫声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At any moment she expected the puppy to crush her. It was running back and forth, barking wildly. Finally it got tired and lay down, panting. The puppy's tongue was hanging out, and its eyes were closing.<br>
            "This is probably a good time to escape," Alice said. While the puppy rested, Alice quietly slipped away. She ran and ran until she could barely hear the puppy barking.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真是只可爱的小狗。”&nbsp;爱丽丝气喘吁吁地说。她靠在一朵小花旁休息，用花的叶子扇风。“如果我变大，就可以训练它了。我需要变大起来，但是该怎么办呢？我应该去吃点或者喝点什么，但是有什么呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That was a nice puppy," Alice said breathlessly. She rested against a tiny flower, fanning herself with one of its leaves. "If I were bigger, I could teach it some tricks. I really do need to grow bigger again. But how will I do that? I suppose I should eat or drink something, but what?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这是个好问题。爱丽丝看看周围的花和草，但是她找不到任何有帮助的东西。在她附近，有一个非常大的蘑菇。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            That was a good question. Alice looked around at the flowers and grass. But she couldn't see anything that might help her. There was a big mushroom growing near her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝在蘑菇下面找了找。然后，她踮起脚尖，&nbsp;想看看蘑菇上面有什么。<br>
            她刚好看到一只蓝色毛毛虫。&nbsp;毛毛虫双臂交叉，正安静地坐在蘑菇上面。很长一段时间，他们俩只是互相看着对方，谁也不说话。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice looked under it. Then she stood on tiptoe, trying to see what was on the top of the mushroom.<br>
            She happened to see a blue caterpillar. The caterpillar was sitting quietly on top of the mushroom with his arms folded. They stared at each other in silence for quite some time.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛毛虫终于对爱丽丝说话了。<br>
            “你是谁？”&nbsp;他用犯困的声音问。&nbsp;<br>
            这不是一个好的开头。爱丽丝害羞地回答：“我不知道，先生。今天早上起来，我还知道自己是谁，但是之后我变了好几次。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At last the Caterpillar spoke to Alice.<br>
            "Who are you?" he asked in a sleepy voice.<br>
            This was not a good start. Alice replied rather shyly, "I hardly know, sir. At least I know who I was when I got up this morning. But I've changed several times since then."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那是什么意思？解释给我听听。”&nbsp;毛毛虫说。<br>
            虽然毛毛虫看上去很没有礼貌，爱丽丝还是试着礼貌地回答。“不好意思，先生，我没办法解释得更详细了。在一天里不断地变大变小让我觉得很困惑。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不会啊！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What do you mean by that? Explain yourself," the Caterpillar said.<br>
            Alice tried to be polite even though the Caterpillar seemed rather rude. "I am sorry, sir. I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly. Being so many different sizes in one day is confusing."<br>
            "No, it isn't."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “可能你还没有机会知道。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“当你变成蝴蝶的时候，你很可能也会觉得奇怪。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不会啊！”&nbsp;毛毛虫说。<br>
            “你可能跟我的感觉不一样。”&nbsp;爱丽丝仍然尽量保持礼貌地说，“但是对我来说，变成蝴蝶会是一件非常奇怪的事情。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Perhaps you haven't had the chance to find that out yet," Alice said. "When you change into a butterfly, you'll probably feel quite strange."<br>
            "I will not," the Caterpillar said.<br>
            "You may feel differently than I do," Alice said, still trying to be polite. "But turning into a butterfly would feel very strange to me."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你！”&nbsp;毛毛虫说，“你是谁？”&nbsp;<br>
            他们的对话又回到了起点。爱丽丝对毛毛虫的话感到很生气。她挺直了自己的身体，盯着毛毛虫说：“我觉得你应该先告诉我你是谁！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You!" The Caterpillar said. "Who are you?"<br>
            And that brought them right back to the beginning of their conversation. Alice felt annoyed by the Caterpillar's remarks. She stood as tall as she could and looked straight at him. "I think you should tell me who you are first!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “为什么呀？”&nbsp;<br>
            这又是一个很难回答的问题。毛毛虫的心情很不好。爱丽丝想要离开了，她开始往其他地方走。<br>
            “回来！”&nbsp;毛毛虫对她叫道，“我有重要的事情跟你说！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why?"<br>
            This was another question that was hard to answer. The Caterpillar was in such a bad mood. Alice wanted to leave, and she started to walk away.<br>
            "Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I have something important to say!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝挺感兴趣。于是她走回来，等毛毛虫说话。<br>
            “不要发脾气。”&nbsp;毛毛虫说。<br>
            “就这样？”&nbsp;爱丽丝非常生气。<br>
            “不是啊！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was interested. So she walked back and waited for him to speak.<br>
            "Don't lose your temper," the Caterpillar said.<br>
            "Is that all?" Alice was very angry.<br>
            "No!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            好几分钟过去了，毛毛虫就静静地坐在那里，不理爱丽丝。爱丽丝又打算离开了，但她其实也没有什么事情可做。于是，她决定继续等待。也许毛毛虫还是会说出什么有趣的事情来。<br>
            毛毛虫终于又说话了。“所以你觉得自己变了?”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For a few minutes, the Caterpillar sat silently, ignoring Alice. She was going to leave, but she really had nothing else to do. So she decided to wait. Perhaps the Caterpillar would have something interesting to say after all.<br>
            Finally he spoke to her again. "So you think you've changed?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的”&nbsp;。爱丽丝说。她很高兴毛毛虫终于听到她说的话了。“一开始我变大了，然后我又变小了。每几分钟我都会变一次。”&nbsp;<br>
            毛毛虫打量了一下爱丽丝。“你想变成多大？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不在乎。我只是不喜欢一直这样变来变去。你知道吧？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, yes," Alice said, happy that he was listening at last. "First I'm bigger, and then I'm smaller. I don't stay the same size for more than a few minutes."<br>
            The Caterpillar looked Alice up and down. "What size do you want to be?"<br>
            "I don't really care. I just don't like changing so often, you know?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不知道啊！”&nbsp;毛毛虫回答。<br>
            爱丽丝什么也没说。她从来没有见过这么不友好的动物。她要发脾气了。<br>
            毛毛虫打断了她的思路。“那你现在满意吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我想要变大，因为三英寸是个让人讨厌的高度。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, I don't know!" the Caterpillar replied.<br>
            Alice said nothing. She'd never met such a disagreeable creature, and she was losing her temper.<br>
            The Caterpillar interrupted her thoughts. "Are you happy now?"<br>
            "I'd like to be larger because three inches is such a horrible size."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “三英寸是个完美的高度！”&nbsp;毛毛虫站起来，让爱丽丝看到他刚好就是三英寸。<br>
            “但是我根本就不习惯！”&nbsp;爱丽丝抱怨说。<br>
            “你很快就会习惯了。”&nbsp;毛毛虫说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Three inches is the perfect height!" The Caterpillar stretched upright as he spoke, showing that he was exactly three inches high.<br>
            "But I'm not used to it!" Alice moaned. <br>
            "You'll get used to it in time," said the Caterpillar.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝等了等，希望毛毛虫能多说些话。等到最后，他只是打了两次哈欠，摇了摇身体。然后，他从蘑菇上爬了下来。<br>
            “一边能让你变大。”&nbsp;毛毛虫说，“一边能让你变小。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice waited, hoping the Caterpillar would say something more. Eventually he yawned twice, and shook himself. Then he got down from the mushroom.<br>
            "One side makes you grow taller," the Caterpillar said. "And the other side makes you smaller."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝不知道他在说什么。“什么的一边？什么的另一边？”&nbsp;她想。<br>
            “蘑菇啊！”&nbsp;毛毛虫回答，好像爱丽丝刚才把问题问出声了一样。过了一会儿，他就不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice wondered what in the world he was talking about. "One side of what? The other side of what?" she thought.<br>
            "Of the mushroom!" The Caterpillar replied as if Alice had asked her questions aloud. And in another moment, he was out of sight.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            毛毛虫说蘑菇的一边会让爱丽丝变大，另外一边会让她变小。&nbsp;说完，他就消失了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Caterpillar had said that one side of the mushroom would make Alice grow. The other side would make her shrink. Then he'd disappeared.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝仔细地看了一下那个蘑菇。“我怎么知道哪一边让我变大，哪一边让我变小呢？蘑菇盖是圆的，所以没有左边和右边。”&nbsp;<br>
            只有一种方法了。爱丽丝张开双臂，两只手分别取下一块。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice studied the mushroom. "How am I supposed to know which side does which? The mushroom cap is round, so it doesn't have a left side or a right side."<br>
            There was only one way to find out. Alice stretched her arms around the mushroom and broke off a piece with each hand.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但是，哪一块可以让我变大呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝看了看手上的蘑菇。最后，她决定先吃右手的蘑菇。她的下巴马上就碰到一个硬硬的东西，是她的脚！<br>
            爱丽丝吓坏了，但她还是吃到了左手的蘑菇。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But which piece makes me grow?" Alice looked at the mushroom pieces in her hands. She finally decided to try the piece in her right hand. The next moment her chin hit something hard. It was her foot!<br>
            Alice was frightened, but she managed to try the mushroom piece in her left hand.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在好多了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝开始变大时开心地说。她的脖子变长了，她却又害怕了起来。爱丽丝看不到自己的肩膀了。她往下看，只能看到自己的长脖子和一些叶子。她并没有发现那些叶子是树顶。<br>
            “我的手去了哪里？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问。她看不到叶子的下面，所以她把脖子弯了下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's better!" Alice said as she started to grow bigger. Her neck was growing longer and she was frightened again. She couldn't see her shoulders. When she looked down, all she saw were her long neck and some green leaves. She didn't realize those were the tops of trees.<br>
            "Where have my hands gone?" Alice asked. She couldn't see them below the leaves, so she bent her neck.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我的脖子真灵活！我好像变成了一条蛇。啊！”&nbsp;一只鸟撞到了爱丽丝的脸，她吓了一跳。<br>
            “蛇！”&nbsp;鸽子尖叫道。<br>
            “我不是蛇！”&nbsp;爱丽丝生气地说，“别烦我！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My neck is so flexible! It's almost like being a serpent. Ah!" A bird flew at Alice's face and she was surprised.<br>
            "Serpent!" the Pigeon screamed.<br>
            "I'm not a serpent!" Alice said angrily. "Leave me alone!"

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不管我在哪里筑巢，蛇都会来找麻烦！”&nbsp;鸽子生气地说，“不管是白天还是晚上，我都得提防着蛇。我已经三个星期没有睡觉了！”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No matter where I make my nest, serpents bother me!" The Pigeon sounded angry. "Night and day I must be on the lookout for serpents. I haven't slept in three weeks!"<br>
            "I'm very sorry that you've been annoyed by serpents," Alice began. "But . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我把巢建在最高的树上，觉得这样就没有蛇了。”&nbsp;鸽子说，“但是，你还是从天上爬了下来！走开，蛇！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不是蛇。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我是……我是……”&nbsp;<br>
            “你是什么？”&nbsp;鸽子追问，“你想说什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I made my nest in the tallest tree, thinking I'd be free of the serpents," the Pigeon said. "But then you came wiggling down from the sky! Go away, Serpent!"<br>
            "I'm not a serpent," Alice said. "I'm a . . . I'm a . . ."<br>
            "Well! What are you?" the Pigeon demanded. "What are you trying to say?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我……我是一个小女孩儿。”&nbsp;爱丽丝最后说。她已经经历了太多的变化，她自己也不确定自己是谁了。<br>
            “我见过许多小女孩儿，但是从来没有看到过有这么长脖子的。”&nbsp;鸽子怀疑地看着她，“&nbsp;不，你是蛇！你就是蛇！你肯定还会跟我说你从来都没吃过蛋吧？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I . . . I'm a little girl," Alice finally said. She'd undergone so many changes, she wasn't sure what she was anymore.<br>
            "I've seen lots of little girls but never one with such a long neck." The Pigeon looked at her skeptically. "No, you're a serpent! And you can't deny it! Next you'll be telling me that you've never eaten an egg."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我吃过蛋。”&nbsp;爱丽丝坦白地说，“小女孩儿和蛇一样经常吃蛋。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不相信。”&nbsp;鸽子坚定地说，“不管你是小女孩儿还是蛇，你在找蛋。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I have eaten an egg," Alice admitted for she was a truthful child. "Little girls eat eggs as often as serpents do."<br>
            "I don't believe that," the Pigeon said firmly. "And whether you're a girl or a serpent, you're looking for eggs."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我没有在找蛋。就算我在找蛋，我也不想要你的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝跺了跺脚，大地都震动了。“我不喜欢生的蛋！”&nbsp;<br>
            “那就走开！”&nbsp;鸽子还是很生气。她回到了自己的巢里。<br>
            爱丽丝想要蹲在树中间，但是她的脖子总是缠到树枝上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm not looking for eggs. But if I were looking for them, I wouldn't want yours." Alice stamped her foot, and the ground shook. "I don't like raw eggs!"<br>
            "Then go away!" The Pigeon still sounded angry. She settled into her nest.<br>
            Alice tried to crouch among the trees, but her neck kept getting tangled in branches.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我需要变成原来的大小。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语地说。<br>
            她小心翼翼地吃了一块蘑菇，然后又吃了另一块蘑菇。最后，她变成了原来的样子。<br>
            “这样好多了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她开始在树林里行走。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I need to get back to my original size," she said to herself.<br>
            Slowly and carefully, Alice nibbled from one piece of mushroom and then the other. At last, she was the correct size.<br>
            "That's much better!" Alice said as she began to walk through the woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，她来到了一个大概四英尺高的房子前面。“不知道谁住在这里。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“但是，他们一定比我小。我这么大，会吓到他们。”&nbsp;<br>
            于是，爱丽丝又吃了一点蘑菇，直到自己只有九英寸高。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly she came upon a space surrounding a house about four feet high. "I don't know who lives there," Alice said. "But they're sure to be smaller than I am, and I'll frighten them at this size."<br>
            So Alice ate some more from the mushroom until she was only nine inches high.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝站在房子外面，不知道该怎么办。突然，一名穿着制服的仆人从树林里跑出来。仆人有一张鱼一样的脸。他敲了敲门，另外一名仆人开了门。这名仆人有着青蛙一样的圆脸和眼睛。爱丽丝发现他们都戴着假发。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice stood outside the house, unsure what to do next. Suddenly a footman in uniform ran out of the woods. The footman had a face like a fish. He knocked on the door, which was answered by another footman. This one had a round face and eyes like a frog. Alice noticed that both wore wigs.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不知道会发生什么。”&nbsp;爱丽丝蹑手蹑脚地靠近听。<br>
            鱼仆人拿着一封很大的信。他把信交给青蛙仆人。“王后寄来的，”&nbsp;鱼仆人说，“邀请公爵夫人去玩槌球。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wonder what's going to happen." Alice crept closer to listen.<br>
            The Fish Footman was holding a big letter. He handed it to the Frog Footman. "From the Queen," the Fish Footman said. "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这一定是公爵夫人的家。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语地说，“不知道她是不是白兔说的那个公爵夫人。”&nbsp;<br>
            两名仆人鞠了个躬，他们的假发缠在了一起。爱丽丝大笑起来。为了不让仆人听到，她跑到了树林里。当她再往外偷看时，鱼仆人已经走了。青蛙仆人坐在地上，看着天空。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This must be the Duchess' house," Alice said to herself. "I wonder if she's the Duchess that the White Rabbit was talking about."<br>
            The two footmen bowed low, tangling their curls together. Alice laughed. She ran into the woods so they wouldn't hear her. When she peeped out again, the Fish Footman was gone. The Frog Footman was sitting on the ground, staring at the sky.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝走到房子门前，轻轻地敲了敲门。<br>
            “敲门是没用的。”&nbsp;青蛙仆人说，“首先，我和你都在外面，所以我不能帮你开门。其次，他们在里面非常吵，没有人会听见。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice went to the door of the house and knocked quietly.<br>
            "There's no point in knocking," the Frog Footman said. "First, I'm out here with you, so I can't open the door. Second, they're making so much noise inside, no one can hear you."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝把耳朵靠在门上听。青蛙仆人说得对。里面非常吵，时不时还有很大的碰撞声。<br>
            “听上去像是盘子破碎的声音！”&nbsp;爱丽丝对青蛙仆人说，“但是我该怎么进去呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice put her ear on the door to listen. The Frog Footman was right. It was very noisy inside, every once in a while came a great crash.<br>
            "That sounds like dishes breaking!" Alice said to the Frog Footman. "But how will I get inside?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            青蛙仆人不知道该怎么办。“我要在这外面坐一整天。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            就在这时，门开了。一个盘子飞了出来。盘子差点儿打到青蛙仆人，最后撞到树上摔碎了。青蛙仆人继续坐着，好像什么都没发生一样。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Frog Footman had no idea. "I'm going to sit out here all day," he said.<br>
            Just then the door opened. A plate flew outside. It almost hit the Frog Footman and finally it smashed against a tree. He continued to sit as if nothing had happened.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “也许我该在这里坐到明天。”&nbsp;他轻声说。<br>
            爱丽丝决定自己开门。一开门就是厨房，厨房里全是烟。公爵夫人坐在凳子上喂着一个小宝宝。厨师在火边搅拌着一锅汤。爱丽丝开始打喷嚏。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Or maybe I'll sit here until tomorrow," he said quietly.<br>
            Alice decided to open the door herself. The door led right into the kitchen, which was full of smoke. The Duchess sat on a stool, feeding a baby. The Cook was stirring a pot of soup over the fire. Alice began to sneeze.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “汤里放太多胡椒粉了！”&nbsp;她喊道。<br>
            小宝宝一会儿打喷嚏一会儿哭。公爵夫人每过一会儿就打一个喷嚏，但是厨师一个喷嚏也没有打。一只猫躺在暖炉边，咧着嘴笑。它也没有打喷嚏。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There's too much pepper in that soup!" she cried.<br>
            The baby took turns sneezing and howling. The Duchess sneezed once in a while, but the Cook didn't sneeze at all. A cat was lying on the hearth and grinning. It didn't sneeze either.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我从来没有看过这样笑的猫。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “那是你从来没有注意到过。”&nbsp;公爵夫人说，“所有的猫都会咧嘴笑，而这只柴郡猫特别会笑。猪！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I've never seen a cat grin like that," Alice said.<br>
            "Then you haven't been paying attention," the Duchess said. "All cats know how to grin, but this Cheshire Cat is especially good at it. Pig!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公爵夫人说最后一个字时声音特别大，爱丽丝吓得跳了起来。然而，她很快发现公爵夫人是在和小宝宝说话。那个小宝宝长着小小的眼睛和猪一样的鼻子。<br>
            爱丽丝还没张口说话，厨师就开始扔东西。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Duchess said this last word so loudly that Alice jumped. Then she realized the Duchess was speaking to the baby. The baby had tiny eyes and a nose like a snout.<br>
            Before Alice could say a word, the Cook started throwing things.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “小心一点！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“你会伤害到小宝宝的！”&nbsp;<br>
            公爵夫人把小宝宝扔给爱丽丝。“给你，你愿意的话就喂他。我要去准备和王后打槌球了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Watch what you're doing!" Alice said. "You're going to hurt the baby!"<br>
            The Duchess tossed the baby to Alice. "Here, you can feed the baby if you like. I must get ready to play croquet with the Queen."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公爵夫人说完，匆忙离开了房间。爱丽丝尽力抱住不断扭动的小宝宝，而那只柴郡猫只是在一旁咧嘴笑着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And with that, the Duchess hurried from the room. Alice tried to hold onto the wiggling baby while the Cheshire Cat simply grinned.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小宝宝不停地扭动，爱丽丝很难抱稳他。她只有九英寸高。爱丽丝迅速地把小宝宝抱出公爵夫人的家。<br>
            小宝宝发出哼哼声。爱丽丝仔细地看了看他。&nbsp;他变得越来越像一只猪了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was having trouble holding the wiggling baby. She was still only nine inches high. As quickly as she could, Alice carried the baby outside the Duchess' house.<br>
            The baby grunted, and Alice examined it closely. It looked more and more like a pig.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我回到家以后，该如何对待这个小生命呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            小宝宝发出了更大的哼哼声。这次肯定不会错！<br>
            “这就是一只猪！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她把猪放在地上，猪跑进了树林里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't know what I'll do with this creature when I get home," Alice said.<br>
            The baby grunted loudly. This time there could be no mistake!<br>
            "This is definitely a pig!" Alice said. She put the animal on the ground, and it ran into the woods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝觉得轻松多了。她开始在树林里走。很快，她就被柴郡猫吓了一跳。她看到他正坐在树上，咧嘴笑着。爱丽丝决定问他一个问题。<br>
            “柴郡猫。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。猫的嘴咧得更大了。“请问我应该走哪一条路呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice felt relieved. She started walking. She was soon startled to see the Cheshire Cat, sitting in a tree and grinning. She decided to ask a question.<br>
            "Cheshire Cat," Alice began, and the cat's grin grew wider. "Would you please tell me which way to go from here?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “看你要去哪里。”&nbsp;柴郡猫回答。<br>
            爱丽丝想了想。“只要是个地方，去哪里无所谓。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那你往哪里走就不重要了。”&nbsp;柴郡猫说，“只要你不停地走，就一定可以走到一个地方。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That depends on where you want to go," the Cheshire Cat replied.<br>
            Alice thought for a moment. "I don't really care as long as I get somewhere."<br>
            "Then it doesn't matter where you go," the Cheshire Cat said. "You're sure to get somewhere if you walk far enough."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            虽然这个回答是对的，但是爱丽丝觉得对自己没有什么帮助。她试着提了另外一个问题。“这附近住着哪些人？”&nbsp;<br>
            柴郡猫挥了挥自己的右爪说：“疯帽子住在那边。”&nbsp;然后，他用自己的左爪指了指说：“三月兔住在那边。你喜欢去哪里都行，他们都疯了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            While that answer was true, Alice didn't think it was helpful. She tried another question. "What sort of people live around here?"<br>
            The Cheshire Cat waved his right front paw and said, "The Hatter lives in that direction." Pointing his left front paw, he said, "The March Hare lives over there. Visit whichever you like; they're both mad."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “疯了？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的。他们都疯了。不过，这里的每个人都疯了，包括你。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝非常好奇。“你怎么知道我疯了呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你一定是疯了，要不然你不会在这里。对了，你今天会和王后一起打槌球吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Mad?"<br>
            "Yes, they're both quite insane. Then again, everyone here is mad, even you."<br>
            Alice was curious. "How do you know that I'm mad?"<br>
            "You must be, or you wouldn't be here. By the way, are you playing croquet with the Queen today?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝高兴地鼓了鼓掌。“我很想去，但是我还没有被邀请。”&nbsp;<br>
            “如果你去，你就会在那里看到我。”&nbsp;柴郡猫说。接着，他就消失了。<br>
            爱丽丝一点儿也不惊讶。因为她已经习惯了这些奇怪的事情。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice clapped her hands with delight. "I'd like that very much, but I haven't been invited yet."<br>
            "Well, if you go, you'll see me there," the Cheshire Cat said. And then he vanished.<br>
            Alice wasn't surprised by this because she was getting used to odd things.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            正当她盯着猫消失的地方看的时候，柴郡猫突然又出现了。<br>
            “我忘记问你那个小宝宝怎么样了。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “他变成了猪。”&nbsp;爱丽丝平静地说。<br>
            “我就觉得他会变成猪。”&nbsp;柴郡猫说。然后，他又消失了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            While she was staring at the spot where the cat had been, he suddenly reappeared.<br>
            "I forgot to ask what happened to the baby," he said.<br>
            "He turned into a pig," Alice said calmly.<br>
            "I thought it would turn into a pig," the Cheshire Cat said, and vanished again.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我最好等等，确定他不再回来了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语地说。但是，柴郡猫并没有再次出现。<br>
            过了几分钟，爱丽丝走向三月兔的家。“我见过疯帽子，但我从来没见过三月兔。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'd better wait to be sure he isn't coming back," Alice said to herself. But the Cheshire Cat didn't reappear.<br>
            After a few minutes, Alice walked toward the March Hare's house. "I've seen hatters before, but I've never met a March Hare."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝边说边往上看。柴郡猫正坐在一棵树上。<br>
            “你刚才说‘猪’还是‘竹’？”&nbsp;柴郡猫问。<br>
            “我说的是‘猪’。&nbsp;你突然出现又突然消失，弄得我头都晕了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As Alice said this, she looked up. There was the Cheshire Cat, sitting in a tree.<br>
            "Did you say, 'pig' or 'bamboo'?" the Cheshire Cat asked.<br>
            "I said, 'pig.' I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and disappearing so suddenly. You're making me dizzy!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好吧！”&nbsp;这次，柴郡猫慢慢地消失了。先是他的尾巴，最后是他的嘴。当他的身体全部消失后，他咧着嘴的笑容还停留了很久。<br>
            “我见过没有笑脸的猫，但还没见过没有猫的笑脸呢！”&nbsp;爱丽丝不敢相信地摇摇头。“这是我见过的最奇怪的事情了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "All right." This time the Cheshire Cat vanished slowly, beginning with his tail and ending with his mouth. His grin remained long after the rest of him had disappeared.<br>
            "I've seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat." Alice shook her head in disbelief. "That's the strangest thing I've ever seen!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，爱丽丝就来到了一幢房子前。房子的烟囱像耳朵，屋顶是毛做的。“这一定是三月兔的家。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            因为房子比爱丽丝大，所以爱丽丝想要变大。她吃着蘑菇，直到长到两英尺高。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice soon came to a house. The chimneys were shaped like ears; the roof was made of fur. "That must be the March Hare's house," she said.<br>
            And because the house was bigger than she was, Alice wanted to grow. She nibbled at her mushroom until she was two feet high.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝在三月兔的房子周围走着，她看到一棵树下有一张桌子。三月兔和疯帽子正在喝茶。一只睡鼠坐在他们中间睡觉。三月兔和疯帽子把他们的胳膊支在睡鼠身上聊天。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice walked around the March Hare's house, and she spotted a table under a tree. The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea. A dormouse sat between them, fast asleep. The other two rested their elbows on him as they chatted.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            虽然桌子很大，但是他们三个却挤在一起坐着。爱丽丝一走过来，疯帽子和三月兔就马上站了起来。<br>
            “没位子了！”&nbsp;他们喊道，“没位子了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “胡说！这里有很多位子。”&nbsp;爱丽丝在桌子另一边的扶手椅上坐下。疯帽子和三月兔叹了口气，又坐了下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Although the table was large, all three were crowded at one end. As Alice approached, the Hatter and the March Hare jumped up.<br>
            "There's no room for you!" they cried. "No room at all!"<br>
            "Nonsense! There's plenty of room." Alice sat down in an armchair at the other end of the table. Sighing, the Hatter and the March Hare sat down again.

            “喝点果汁吧！”&nbsp;三月兔说。<br>
            爱丽丝看了一下桌子。“我看到了茶，但没有看到果汁。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那是因为根本没有果汁。”&nbsp;三月兔说。<br>
            “那你还叫我喝果汁，太没有礼貌了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝有点生气。<br>
            “你没有被邀请就坐下来也很没礼貌。”&nbsp;三月兔说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Have some juice," the March Hare said.<br>
            Alice looked around the table. "I see tea, but I don't see any juice."<br>
            "That's because there isn't any," the March Hare said.<br>
            "Then it wasn't very nice of you to offer it." Alice felt impatient.<br>
            "It wasn't very nice of you to sit down without being invited," the March Hare said.

            “你不应该随便评论别人！”&nbsp;爱丽丝责备他。她觉得在这个奇怪的地方，每个人都很无礼。

            "You have plenty of room here," Alice said.<br>
            All this time the Hatter had been silently studying Alice. "You need a haircut," he said.<br>

            疯帽子从口袋里拿出怀表看了看。他摇了摇怀表，又把它放到耳边听。<br>
            “今天是几号？”&nbsp;他问爱丽丝。<br>
            爱丽丝想了一会儿。“四号。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Hatter took his watch from his pocket and studied it. He shook the watch and held it to his ear. <br>
            "What day of the month is it?" he asked Alice.<br>
            She thought for a moment. "The fourth."

            “但是我用的是最好的黄油。”&nbsp;三月兔说。<br>
            “对！但是，你不应该用面包刀把黄油涂到我手表里面。面包屑一定也跟着涂进去了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Hatter sighed. "My watch is off by two days." He gave the March Hare an angry look. "I told you that butter wouldn't fix it."<br>
            "But I used the best kind of butter," the March Hare said.<br>
            "Yes, but you shouldn't have used the bread knife to spread it inside my watch. Some bread crumbs obviously got in as well."

            三月兔拿过怀表，忧伤地看着它。接着，他把表放进茶里涮了一下，然后又拿起来看了看，怀表还是不走。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily. Then he dipped it into his tea and checked it again. The watch still didn't work.<br>
            Alice got up and peered behind him. "What a strange watch! It tells the day of the month but not the hour."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why should it?" the Hatter said. "Does your watch tell you what year it is?"<br>
            "Of course not," Alice said.<br>

            “我不明白。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice sat back down at the other end of the table. "This conversation is boring. I have better things to do with my time than sit here and waste it."<br>

            爱丽丝好奇地问：“比如说？”&nbsp;<br>
            “比如现在是早上九点，你该上课了。你可以悄悄地跟时间说话。突然，时间就会变成下午一点，是午餐时间了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Of course you don't," the Hatter said. "I bet you've never even spoken to Time. If you're friendly with him, he'll do almost anything you ask."<br>
            Alice leaned forward, full of curiosity. "Like what?"<br>
            "Let's say it's nine o'clock in the morning, and you're supposed to start your lessons. You could whisper to Time. And suddenly it would be one o'clock and time for lunch."

            “哦，那就太棒了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“你和时间关系好吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            疯帽子看上去很伤心。“现在不好了。我在红心王后举办的音乐会上唱歌，刚刚开始唱，王后就喊：‘停！你这是在扼杀时间！’。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, that would be wonderful!" Alice said. "Are you friendly with Time?"<br>
            The Hatter looked sad. "Not anymore. I was singing at a concert given by the Queen of Hearts. I'd just begun when the Queen shouted, 'Stop! You're murdering the time!'"

            The Dormouse suddenly woke up again. "The Queen was mad because the Hatter wasn't keeping the beat."<br>

            爱丽丝扫视了一下桌子。桌子上有许多套茶具，但是坐在桌边的只有疯帽子、三月兔和睡鼠。<br>
            “为什么有这么多套茶具？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问疯帽子。<br>
            “时间停在了六点，所以永远都是喝茶时间。”&nbsp;疯帽子解释说，“我们没有时间洗茶具。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice looked around the table. There were many place settings. But the only ones at the table were the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse.<br>
            "Why are there so many dishes?" Alice asked the Hatter.<br>
            "It's always six o'clock, so that means it's always time for tea," he explained. "We don't have time to wash the dishes."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “所以当你需要干净的茶具时，就移到下一套茶具那儿？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问。<br>
            疯帽子点点头。“完全正确。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝想了想。“但是当你重新回到一开始的位置时，该怎么办呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So when you need clean dishes, you move to the next place setting?" Alice asked.<br>
            The Hatter nodded in agreement. "Exactly."<br>
            Alice thought about this for a moment. "But what happens when you come back to where you started?"

            “我们换一个话题吧！”&nbsp;三月兔说，“我觉得有点无聊了。让她给我们讲个故事吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;爱丽丝摇摇头，“我一个故事也不会讲。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那就让睡鼠讲一个吧！”&nbsp;疯帽子和三月兔一起说。他们一人一边掐醒了睡鼠。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let's change the subject," the March Hare said. "I'm getting bored. Let her tell us a story!"<br>
            "What?" Alice shook her head. "But I don't know any stories."<br>
            "Then the Dormouse will tell us one," the March Hare and the Hatter said together. They pinched the Dormouse on both sides at once.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Tell us a story," the March Hare said.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            睡鼠坐直了身子，开始讲故事。“从前，有三个姐妹。她们的名字是艾尔希、蕾希和蒂莉。她们住在井底……"<br>
            “她们会饿吗？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问。她总是对别人吃什么喝什么很感兴趣。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Dormouse sat up straight and began to talk. "Once upon a time, there were three little sisters. Their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. They lived at the bottom of a well . . ."<br>
            "Did they get hungry down there?" Alice asked. She was always interested in what people ate and drank.

            睡鼠想了一会儿。“她们吃糖浆。”&nbsp;他说。<br>

            “是的，她们都病得很厉害。”&nbsp;睡鼠说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Dormouse thought for a moment or two. "They lived on molasses," he finally said.<br>
            Alice shook her head in disbelief. "Impossible!" she said gently. "That would have made them ill."<br>
            "Yes, they were very ill," the Dormouse said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝努力地想象着住在井里的生活，但是她想还是无法想象。“她们为什么要住在井底呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “多喝一点儿茶。”&nbsp;三月兔对她说。<br>
            “我还一点儿都没喝呢！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“所以不能说&nbsp;‘多喝一点儿’。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice tried to imagine what it would be like to live in a well. But she couldn't. "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?"<br>
            "Have some more tea," the March Hare said to her.<br>
            "I've had nothing so far," Alice said. "So you can't say 'have more.'"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “胡说！”&nbsp;三月兔说，“如果你一点儿都没喝，喝一点点都比之前多。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝不知道怎么回答。于是，她喝了一点儿茶，吃了点儿面包和黄油。然后，她又问了一次睡鼠：“为什么她们三姐妹要住在井底呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Nonsense!" the March Hare said. "If you have nothing, anything is more than that."<br>
            Alice didn't know what to say to this. So she helped herself to tea, and bread and butter. Then she turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question. "Why did the sisters live at the bottom of a well?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            睡鼠又想了一会儿。“因为那是一个糖浆井。”&nbsp;<br>
            “没有那样的井！”&nbsp;爱丽丝生气地说。疯帽子和三月兔叫她安静一些。<br>
            睡鼠皱起了眉头。“如果你不能好好听故事，你就自己讲完这个故事吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Again the Dormouse took a few moments to think. "Because it was a molasses well."<br>
            "There's no such thing!" Alice said angrily. The Hatter and March Hare shushed her.<br>
            The Dormouse frowned. "If you can't be nice," he said, "you can finish the story yourself."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对不起，请继续讲，我保证会安静听。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “我要一个干净的杯子。”&nbsp;疯帽子插嘴说。<br>
            于是他们都往右移了一个位子。睡鼠继续讲。“三姐妹在画画儿，她们画以‘小’字开头的东西……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, please go on. I promise to stay quiet and listen," Alice said.<br>
            "I want a clean cup," the Hatter interrupted.<br>
            So they all moved one place to the right, and the Dormouse went on with his story. "The sisters were drawing things beginning with the character 'small' . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “为什么以‘小’字开头？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问，“我不觉得……”&nbsp;<br>
            “那么你就不应该说。”&nbsp;疯帽子说。<br>
            爱丽丝再也受不了这种没有礼貌的态度了，她生气地站了起来。爱丽丝刚走，睡鼠就睡着了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Why with character 'small'?" Alice asked. "I don't think . . ."<br>
            "Then you shouldn't talk," the Hatter said.<br>
            This bit of rudeness was more than Alice could bear. She got up in disgust. As she walked away, the Dormouse fell asleep.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            疯帽子和三月兔没有发现爱丽丝的离开。爱丽丝回头看了几次，希望他们叫她回去。但是，他们正忙着把睡鼠放到茶壶里。<br>
            “我再也不去那里了，”&nbsp;爱丽丝在树林里边走边说，“这是我见过的最愚蠢的茶会了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Hatter and the March Hare didn't seem to notice her leaving. Alice looked back several times, hoping they would call after her. But now they were busy trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. <br>

            Walking through the woods, Alice noticed a tree with a door in its trunk. "That's strange!" she said. "But everything's strange today. I might as well go in and have a look!"<br>
            Alice soon found herself in the hall with the glass table. "Oh, I'm back here again! Let's see if I can do things in the right order this time."

            首先，爱丽丝用金钥匙打开了花园的门。然后，她从口袋里拿出一块蘑菇。她吃着蘑菇，直到变成一英尺高。最后，她穿过门，走进了美丽的花园。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            First, Alice used the gold key to unlock the garden door. Then, she took a piece of mushroom from her pocket. She nibbled it until she was a foot high. Finally, she walked through the door and into the beautiful garden.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            花园入口有一个大玫瑰丛。三个园丁正忙着把白玫瑰花涂成红色。园丁们穿的衣服像扑克牌。爱丽丝看出他们是黑桃二、黑桃五和黑桃七。<br>
            “五，小心点儿！”&nbsp;二说，“你把油漆洒到我身上了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “没办法呀！”&nbsp;五说，“七碰到了我的胳膊。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A large rosebush stood near the entrance. Three gardeners were busy painting the white roses red. The gardeners wore outfits that looked like playing cards. Alice noticed that they were the two, five, and seven of spades.<br>
            "Be careful, Five!" Two said. "You're splashing paint on me."<br>
            "I couldn't help it," Five said. "Seven bumped my elbow."

            爱丽丝突然感到很害羞。“请问你们为什么涂这些花呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            二说：“王后想要红色的玫瑰花丛，但是我们错种成了白玫瑰。如果她发现……”&nbsp;

            Seven scowled. "You're always blaming everyone else, Five! You should . . ."<br>

            Alice suddenly felt a bit shy. "Would you please tell me why you're painting those roses?"<br>
            Two spoke up. "The Queen wanted a red rosebush. But we planted a white one by mistake. If she found out . . ."

            五紧张地四处看了看。“王后！王后！”&nbsp;他大喊。三张扑克牌都立刻趴到了地上。<br>
            爱丽丝抬头看到了游行队伍。首先是十个士兵。他们的衣服也像扑克牌，但他们的身上是梅花。接着是十个王室的孩子，他们的衣服上是红心。后面跟着其他人。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "She'd cut off our heads!" Seven said.<br>
            Five was looking around anxiously. "The Queen! The Queen!" he shouted. All three cards instantly threw themselves on the ground, facedown.<br>
            Alice looked up to see a parade. First came ten soldiers. Their outfits were shaped like playing cards too, but they had clubs. Next came ten royal children, whose outfits had hearts. After that came some others.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “白兔在那里!”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。白兔看上去很紧张，他经过的时候没有注意到爱丽丝。<br>
            接着走来的是红心武士，他的父母跟在后面，是红心国王和红心王后。<br>
            当国王和王后走到爱丽丝面前时，他们停了下来。其他人也停了下来，转过来看着她。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There's the White Rabbit!" Alice said. He seemed quite nervous and didn't notice her as he passed.<br>
            Then came the Knave of Hearts, followed by his parents, the King and Queen of Hearts.<br>
            When the King and Queen reached Alice, they stopped. Everyone else stopped too, turning to stare at her.
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你是谁？”&nbsp;王后问。<br>
            “我的名字叫爱丽丝。”&nbsp;爱丽丝大声而礼貌地回答。但她心里想：“他们只是一堆扑克牌，根本不需要怕他们。”&nbsp;<br>
            王后看到了三个园丁。他们的背和士兵以及孩子们的背是一样的。“这些人是谁？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Who are you?" the Queen demanded.<br>
            "My name is Alice," she said aloud in a polite voice. But to herself she said, "They're only a pack of cards! There's no need to be afraid of them."<br>
            The Queen noticed the three gardeners. Their backs matched those of her soldiers and her children. "And who are these people?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我怎么知道？”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。爱丽丝对自己的勇气感到惊讶。<br>
            王后的脸变得通红，她大声说：“砍掉她的头！”&nbsp;<br>
            “荒唐！”&nbsp;爱丽丝大声说。王后不说话了，她看上去很生气。<br>
            国王把手放在王后的手臂上。“她只是个孩子。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How should I know?" Alice said, surprised at her own courage.<br>
            Turning bright red, the Queen screamed, "Off with her head!"<br>
            "Nonsense!" Alice said loudly. The Queen went silent, but she still looked angry.<br>
            The King put his hand on the Queen's arm. "She's only a child," he said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “起来！”&nbsp;王后朝园丁们喊道。<br>
            三个园丁跳起来，开始向每一个人鞠躬。<br>
            “停！我的头都晕了！”&nbsp;王后喊。她指着玫瑰花丛说：“这是怎么回事？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Get up!" the Queen screamed at the gardeners.<br>
            The three gardeners popped up and began bowing to everyone at once.<br>
            "Stop that! You're making me dizzy!" the Queen shouted. She pointed to the rosebush. "What's going on here?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们在涂……”&nbsp;二开始解释。<br>
            “我明白了！砍掉他们的头！”&nbsp;王后喊道。游行队伍继续往前走。<br>
            三个园丁吓坏了，跑到爱丽丝那里寻求帮助。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We're trying . . . ," Two began.<br>
            "I can see that! Off with their heads!" the Queen shouted, and the parade began to move again.<br>
            The gardeners were terrified and ran to Alice for protection.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不会让士兵伤害到你们的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。当士兵们到处寻找园丁的时候，她快速地把园丁们藏进了花盆里。<br>
            “他们的头掉了没有？”&nbsp;王后朝士兵们大喊。<br>
            “当然了，王后。”&nbsp;士兵们回答。他们放弃了搜寻，回到了游行队伍里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I won't let the soldiers hurt you," she said. While the soldiers searched for the gardeners, Alice quickly hid the gardeners in a flowerpot.<br>
            "Are their heads off?" the Queen shouted back at the soldiers.<br>
            "Of course, Your Majesty," the soldiers replied. Giving up their search, they joined the end of the parade.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后转过来对爱丽丝大喊：“你会玩儿槌球吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝很惊讶，但她还是回答：“会。”&nbsp;<br>
            “那跟我们来吧！”&nbsp;王后喊。于是爱丽丝也加入了游行队伍。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Queen shouted over her shoulder to Alice. "Can you play croquet?"<br>
            Alice was surprised, but she replied, "Yes."<br>
            "Then come with us," the Queen called, and Alice joined the parade.

            王后的游行队伍来到打槌球的草地上。这时，爱丽丝听到身后传来一个温柔的声音。<br>
            “今天……天气很好。”&nbsp;白兔说。他紧张地看着爱丽丝。<br>
            “确实很好。”&nbsp;爱丽丝回答，“公爵夫人在哪里？”&nbsp;<br>
            “小声点儿！”&nbsp;白兔赶紧说。他四处看了看，然后对着爱丽丝的耳朵悄悄说：“公爵夫人已经被处以死刑。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Queen's parade reached the croquet lawn. Then Alice heard a soft voice beside her.<br>
            "Today . . . is a fine day," the White Rabbit said. He looked anxiously at Alice.<br>
            "Very fine indeed," Alice replied. "Where's the Duchess?"<br>
            "Be quiet!" the White Rabbit said quickly. He looked over his shoulder before whispering in Alice's ear. "The Duchess has been sentenced to death."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝很惊讶。“她做了什么事？”&nbsp;<br>
            “她打了王后一巴掌，然后……”&nbsp;白兔开始说。<br>
            爱丽丝紧张地笑了笑。<br>
            “嘘！别让王后听到了！”&nbsp;白兔害怕地说，“公爵夫人迟到了，然后……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice looked surprised. "What did she do?"<br>
            "She slapped the Queen's face, then . . ." the White Rabbit began.<br>
            Alice laughed nervously.<br>
            "Hush before the Queen hears you!" the White Rabbit said, sounding frightened. "The Duchess arrived late, and . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “各就各位！”&nbsp;王后大喊。<br>
            大家开始到处乱跑，互相绊倒。然而，他们很快就找好了位置。槌球比赛开始了。<br>
            “这是我见过的最奇怪的槌球比赛。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“球是刺猬，槌是火烈鸟。那些士兵在干什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Go to your places!" the Queen roared.<br>
            People began running in all directions, tripping over each other. However, they soon settled down, and the croquet game began.<br>
            "This is the strangest croquet game I've ever seen," Alice said. "The balls are hedgehogs, and the mallets are flamingos. And what are those soldiers doing?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            士兵们弯下腰，手扶在地上。<br>
            “哦，我明白了，他们是球门！”&nbsp;爱丽丝叫道。她抱起自己的火烈鸟。<br>
            但是，她的火烈鸟不是很配合。爱丽丝不知道该怎么用它做槌。火烈鸟疑惑地看着爱丽丝，爱丽丝大笑起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The soldiers were bending over so their hands touched the ground.<br>
            "Oh, I see. They're the wickets!" Alice exclaimed. She picked up her flamingo.<br>
            But her flamingo wouldn't cooperate. Alice couldn't figure out how to hold it as a mallet. The bird kept looking at her with a puzzled expression, and Alice laughed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝的刺猬展开身子走了。士兵们总是站起来伸展身体，地板也凹凸不平。<br>
            “这样玩儿槌球真的太难了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            球手们没有按顺序打球。大家同时一起打，所以引起了许多争吵。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice's hedgehog unrolled itself and began to walk away. The soldiers kept getting up to stretch, and the ground was too rough to play on.<br>
            "This is a hard way to play croquet," Alice said.<br>
            The players didn't take turns. Instead they all made their shots at once, which led to many arguments.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，王后就跺着脚到处走，大喊：“砍掉他的头！砍掉她的头！”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝非常不安。“我可不想让王后生气。”&nbsp;她想，“那就危险了。”&nbsp;<br>
            突然，她看到一个奇怪的东西飘在空中——是一个咧嘴的笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon the Queen was stomping around, shouting, "Off with his head! Off with her head!"<br>
            Alice began to feel uneasy. "I hope I don't do anything to upset the Queen," she thought. "That could be dangerous."<br>
            Suddenly she saw something odd floating in the air—a grin.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那个笑脸越来越清晰。“是柴郡猫！”&nbsp;爱丽丝开心地说，“现在有人和我说话了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你好吗？”&nbsp;柴郡猫问。<br>
            “在他的耳朵出现之前回答也没有用。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语地说，“他还听不到。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The image grew clearer. "It's the Cheshire Cat!" Alice said happily. "Now I’ll have somebody to talk to."<br>
            "How are you doing?" the Cheshire Cat asked.<br>
            "There's no use replying until his ears show up," Alice said to herself. "He can't hear me yet."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，柴郡猫的整个头都出现了。爱丽丝把火烈鸟放下，开始描述槌球比赛。柴郡猫的身体一直都没有出现。<br>
            “他们没有按顺序打球。”&nbsp;爱丽丝抱怨说，“而且用动物和士兵来打球真的太难了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In another minute the Cheshire Cat's whole head was visible. Alice put down her flamingo and began to describe the croquet game. Meanwhile the Cheshire Cat's body remained invisible.<br>
            "Nobody take turns," Alice complained. "And it's so difficult using live animals and soldiers."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你喜欢王后吗？”&nbsp;柴郡猫小声问。<br>
            “我一点儿都不喜欢她。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“她太……”&nbsp;就在这时，爱丽丝注意到王后在身后。她的脸变红了。“我的意思是，王后很可能赢，所以不需要再跟她比下去了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How do you like the Queen?" the Cheshire Cat asked quietly.<br>
            "I don't like her at all," Alice said. "She's so . . ." Just then Alice noticed the Queen listening nearby. She blushed. "I mean, the Queen is likely to win, so it's not worth finishing the game."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后笑了笑，走开了。爱丽丝继续聊天。国王走过来，看着柴郡猫的脸。<br>
            “你在和谁说话？”&nbsp;他问爱丽丝。<br>
            “这是我的好朋友，柴郡猫。”&nbsp;她说，“我来给您介绍一下。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Queen smiled and passed by. As Alice continued to talk, the King approached and stared at the Cheshire Cat's head.<br>
            "Who are you talking to?" the King asked Alice.<br>
            "This is a good friend of mine, the Cheshire Cat," she said. "Let me introduce you."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不喜欢这只猫，我要马上弄走他。”&nbsp;国王对王后大喊：“亲爱的！请把那只猫弄走！”&nbsp;<br>
            王后不管事情大小，都只有一个方法解决。“砍掉他的头！”&nbsp;她大喊。<br>
            于是，国王去找刽子手了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't like that cat at all. He must be removed at once." The King called out to the Queen. "My dear! Please have this cat removed!"<br>
            The Queen had only one way of dealing with problems, large or small. "Off with his head!" she cried.<br>
            The King went to fetch the Executioner.

            柴郡猫的头浮在空中，但是他没有回答。爱丽丝决定去看看发生了什么事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            While the King was fetching the Executioner, Alice heard the Queen shouting.<br>

            The Cheshire Cat's head floated above Alice, but he didn't reply. She decided to find out what was going on.

            槌球比赛还是很奇怪。<br>
            “砍掉他的头！”&nbsp;爱丽丝走近时，王后正大声叫喊着。王后指着另外一个球手说：“也砍掉她的头！”&nbsp;<br>
            “他们做错了什么？”&nbsp;爱丽丝问白兔。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The croquet game was as strange as ever.<br>
            "Off with his head!" the Queen shouted as Alice approached. The Queen pointed to another player. "Off with her head too!"<br>
            "What did those players do?" Alice asked the White Rabbit.

    </div>
    <div>

            “他们没有集中注意力，所以轮到他们打球的时候没有打。”&nbsp;白兔回答。<br>
            “不好了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我在跟柴郡猫说话的时候很可能也错过了，我可不想掉脑袋。我最好去找我的球，不对，是我的刺猬。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They weren't paying attention, so they missed their turns," the White Rabbit replied.<br>
            "Oh no!" Alice said. "I probably missed my turn when I was talking to the Cheshire Cat. I don't want to lose my head. I'd better hunt for my ball. I mean, my hedgehog."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝很快就找到了她的刺猬。她的刺猬正和另外一只刺猬打架。她并没有阻止它们。“我的槌呢？不对，我的火烈鸟呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            她四处看了看，看到她的火烈鸟在花园的另一边。当她抱起火烈鸟时，刺猬们已经不打架了。事实上，它们已经不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice quickly found her hedgehog. Her hedgehog was fighting with another hedgehog. She didn't try to separate them. "Where's my mallet? I mean, where's my flamingo?"<br>
            She looked around and spotted her flamingo across the garden. By the time she grabbed it, the hedgehogs had stopped fighting. In fact, they were nowhere in sight.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它们不见了也没关系。”&nbsp;爱丽丝自言自语地说，“反正也没有球门了。所有的士兵都走了。”&nbsp;<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It doesn't matter that they've disappeared," Alice said to herself. "There are no wickets anyway. All the soldiers have walked away."<br>
            She tucked the flamingo under her arm and returned to the Cheshire Cat. She was surprised to find a crowd gathered below his head. There was a loud argument going on.

            “不要胡说八道了！”&nbsp;国王说，“你只需要一个头，现在这里有一个头……”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Queen gave an impatient snort. "If somebody doesn't do something right now, I'll order everyone's head cut off!"<br>
            After that threat everyone in the crowd looked frightened.<br>
            Alice thought for a moment. Finally she said, "The Cheshire Cat belongs to the Duchess. You'd better ask her what to do about it.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “公爵夫人在监狱里，”&nbsp;王后对刽子手说，“马上带她过来。”&nbsp;<br>
            刽子手跑去找公爵夫人。刽子手一走，柴郡猫的头就开始慢慢消失。当刽子手带着公爵夫人回来时，猫的头已经不见了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The Duchess is in prison," the Queen said to the Executioner. "Bring her here at once."<br>
            The Executioner ran off to fetch the Duchess. The moment the Executioner was gone, the Cheshire Cat's head began to fade away. By the time the Executioner returned with the Duchess, the Cat had disappeared.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王和刽子手去寻找柴郡猫，其他人继续玩儿槌球。公爵夫人挽着爱丽丝的手臂，和爱丽丝一起走了。<br>
            “亲爱的朋友，又见到你了，真开心。”&nbsp;公爵夫人拍了拍爱丽丝的手臂。<br>
            “看到你我也很开心。”&nbsp;爱丽丝回答。她对公爵夫人的友好感到惊讶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            While the King and the Executioner searched for the Cheshire Cat, everyone else played croquet. The Duchess tucked her arm into Alice's, and they walked away.<br>
            "I'm so glad to see you again, my dear." The Duchess patted Alice's arm.<br>
            "And I'm glad to see you," Alice replied.  She was surprised that the Duchess was so friendly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝和公爵夫人边走边聊。爱丽丝想问一问关于柴郡猫的事，但是公爵夫人不停地说着话。突然，公爵夫人不说了。她的手臂颤抖着。爱丽丝抬起头，看到王后挡在了她们的前面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice and the Duchess walked and talked. Alice wanted to ask about the Cheshire Cat, but the Duchess was busy talking. Suddenly the Duchess' voice died away. Her arm shook. Alice looked up and saw the Queen blocking their path.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “您好！”&nbsp;公爵夫人说。<br>
            王后并不想看到公爵夫人。“快点儿离开，要不然我就砍掉你的头！”&nbsp;她大喊。<br>
            公爵夫人赶紧走了。王后对爱丽丝说：“我们再去玩儿槌球吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello," the Duchess said.<br>
            The Queen was not happy to see the Duchess. "Leave immediately or off with your head!" she shouted.<br>
            The Duchess hurried away, and the Queen turned to Alice. "Let's join the game!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝跟着王后回到了槌球场，球手们正在树荫下休息。他们一看到王后，就跳了起来。<br>
            “你们为什么躺下了？一群懒人！”&nbsp;王后质问道，“给我马上开始！我警告你们！迟一点点我就要你们的命！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice followed the Queen back to the croquet game. The players were taking a break and resting in the shade. As soon as they spotted the Queen, they leaped to their feet.<br>
            "Why were you lying down, you lazy things?" the Queen demanded. "Start playing again at once! I'm warning you! A moment's delay will cost you your life!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            球手们马上动了起来，但王后还是不开心。她不停地喊：“砍掉他的头！砍掉她的头！”&nbsp;<br>
            王后每喊一次，一名士兵就要带一个人去监狱。<br>
            “监狱应该快满了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想，“我们也快没有球门了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The players quickly followed the Queen's orders, but she still wasn't happy. She kept shouting, "Off with his head! Off with her head!"<br>
            Every time the Queen shouted, a soldier took someone to prison.<br>
            "The prison must be filling up," Alice thought. "And we're losing wickets again too."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            士兵们因为要听从王后的命令，不能继续当球门了。很快就没有球门了，球手们也都进了监狱，除了国王、王后和爱丽丝。<br>
            “除了国王和我，再也没有人可以让王后惩罚了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The soldiers had to stop being the wickets to follow the Queen's orders. Soon there were no wickets, and all the players were in jail. That is, all the players except the King, the Queen, and Alice.<br>
            "There's nobody left for her to punish except the King and me!" Alice thought.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是，王后已经不想再惩罚人了。她气喘吁吁地转过来问爱丽丝：“你今天见到素甲鱼了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我从来都没有见过素甲鱼。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “跟我来。”&nbsp;王后说，“我们去找他，他会给你讲他的故事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the Queen had finished punishing people. Out of breath, she turned to Alice. "Have you seen the Mock Turtle today?" the Queen asked.<br>
            "I've never seen one in my life," Alice said.<br>
            "Come with me," the Queen said. "We'll find him, and he'll tell you his story."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝和王后离开的时候，她听到国王在自言自语。<br>
            “我要去监狱放了所有的人。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “这是好事。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝和王后很快就看到一个在阳光下睡觉的奇怪的动物。这个动物有着老鹰一样的头和翅膀，还有狮子一样的身体。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As they walked away, Alice heard the King talking to himself.<br>
            "I'm going to the prison to pardon everyone," he said.<br>
            "Well, that's good," Alice thought.<br>
            Alice and the Queen soon saw a strange winged creature sleeping in the sun. The animal had the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是鹰头狮！”&nbsp;爱丽丝惊叫道，“我从来没有想过我能在现实生活中看到。”&nbsp;<br>
            鹰头狮动了动，但没有醒。王后过去叫醒了他。<br>
            “给我起来！”&nbsp;王后大叫，“快带这位年轻的小姐去听素甲鱼讲故事，我要去监狱看看。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, that's a gryphon!" Alice exclaimed. "I never thought I'd see one in real life."<br>
            The creature moved but didn't wake up. The Queen took care of that.<br>
            "Get up right now!" the Queen bellowed. "Take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle and hear his story. I must go to the prison and check on my prisoners."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            王后走了之后，鹰头狮坐了起来，揉了揉眼睛。他看着王后离开。爱丽丝有点儿害怕这只奇怪的动物。“但是跟他在一起应该比跟王后在一起安全吧！”&nbsp;爱丽丝心想。<br>
            “王后是个有趣的人。”&nbsp;鹰头狮边说边站了起来。“刽子手从来都没有砍掉谁的头。一切都只是在王后的想象里。我们走吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As the Queen walked away, the Gryphon sat up and rubbed his eyes. He watched the Queen until she was out of sight. Alice was a little afraid of this odd animal. "But I guess I'm safer with him than with the Queen," she thought.<br>
            "The Queen is always so amusing," the Gryphon said as he got to his feet. "The Executioner never cuts off anyone's head, you know. It's all in her imagination. Let's go."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝听到没有人被砍头，非常高兴，但她又得听从另一个动物的指挥，这让她觉得很烦。没走多远，他们就看到了素甲鱼。素甲鱼坐在一块石头上。当他们走近时，爱丽丝可以听到素甲鱼的叹气声和哭泣声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice was glad that no one was ever put to death. But she was annoyed that yet another creature was telling her what to do. They had not walked far before they spotted the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle sitting on a rock. As they approached, Alice could hear him sighing and sobbing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他怎么了？”&nbsp;爱丽丝小声问。<br>
            “没事。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说，“他的问题都只是在他的想象里。”&nbsp;<br>
            素甲鱼两眼泪水地看着他们。<br>
            “这位年轻的小姐想听听你的故事。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's wrong with him?" Alice whispered.<br>
            "Nothing," the Gryphon said. "His problems are all in his imagination."<br>
            The Mock Turtle looked at them with eyes full of tears.<br>
            "This young lady wants to know your story," the Gryphon said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            素甲鱼点点头。“请坐。在我讲完之前请不要说话。”&nbsp;<br>
            于是爱丽丝和鹰头狮坐了下来。他们等了很久，素甲鱼都不说话。“他到底什么时候开始呢？”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mock Turtle nodded. "Sit down, and don't say a word until I've finished."<br>
            So Alice and the Gryphon sat down. They waited and waited for the Mock Turtle to speak. "When will he begin?" Alice thought.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            素甲鱼终于开始讲故事了。故事主要是关于他在学校的学习。他一开始就停不下来了。<br>
            “够了！”&nbsp;鹰头狮打断了素甲鱼，“跟爱丽丝讲讲龙虾舞吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At last the Mock Turtle started his story, which was mostly about his lessons at school. Once he began, he went on and on.<br>
            "That's enough!" the Gryphon finally interrupted in a firm voice. "Tell Alice about the lobster dance."

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            素甲鱼深深地叹了口气，擦了擦眼泪。他看了看爱丽丝，想要说话，但是又哭了起来。<br>
            “别担心。”&nbsp;鹰头狮对爱丽丝说，“他一直就是这个样子的。”&nbsp;<br>
            素甲鱼很快就平静下来了。他开始描述龙虾舞。“你可能没有在海底生活过。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and wiped his eyes with his flippers. He looked at Alice and tried to speak. But he started sobbing instead.<br>
            "Don't worry," the Gryphon said to Alice. "He's always like this."<br>
            The Mock Turtle soon recovered and began to explain the lobster dance. "You probably haven't ever lived under the sea."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “那你可能也没有认识过龙虾。”&nbsp;<br>
            爱丽丝本来想说自己吃过龙虾，但是她忍住了。<br>
            “那你知不知道跳龙虾舞是多么开心的一件事？”&nbsp;素甲鱼说。爱丽丝摇摇头。“不知道。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, I haven't," Alice said.<br>
            "And perhaps you've never been introduced to a lobster."<br>
            Alice started to say that she had eaten a lobster but stopped.<br>
            "So you don't know how delightful a lobster dance is," the Mock Turtle said.<br>
            Alice shook her head. "No, I don't."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鹰头狮加入了谈话。“首先，你们要在岸边站成一排。”&nbsp;<br>
            “是两排。”&nbsp;素甲鱼说，“然后，要把所有的水母都清除掉。”&nbsp;<br>
            “一般需要很长时间。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Gryphon joined the conversation. "First, you stand in a line along the seashore."<br>
            "Two lines," the Mock Turtle corrected him. "Then, after you've cleared all the jellyfish out of the way . . ."<br>
            "That usually takes some time," the Gryphon interrupted.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “往前走两步。”&nbsp;<br>
            “和你的龙虾舞伴一起。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。<br>
            “当然了。”&nbsp;素甲鱼说，“往前走两步，面对你的舞伴，然后……”&nbsp;<br>
            “换一个舞伴。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说，“然后你把龙虾扔到……”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You take two steps forward."<br>
            "With a lobster as a partner," the Gryphon said.<br>
            "Of course," the Mock Turtle said. "You step forward twice, face your partner, then . . ."<br>
            "Change partners," the Gryphon said. "Then you throw the lobsters . . ."
        </div>
    </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “很远的地方。”&nbsp;素甲鱼说。<br>
            “接着，你跟着他们游泳。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。<br>
            “再在海里翻个大跟头！”&nbsp;素甲鱼兴奋地跳着舞。<br>
            “然后再换一个舞伴！”&nbsp;鹰头狮高声大喊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "As far out to sea as you can," the Mock Turtle said.<br>
            "Then you swim after them," the Gryphon said.<br>
            "Then do a somersault in the sea!" The Mock Turtle danced wildly about.<br>
            "And change lobsters again!" the Gryphon yelled at the top of his lungs.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “再回到陆地上。”&nbsp;素甲鱼说，“第一部分的舞蹈就结束了。”&nbsp;<br>
            素甲鱼和鹰头狮在描述的时候跳来跳去。现在，他们都坐下来，看着爱丽丝。<br>
            爱丽丝不知道应该怎么反应。最后她说：“那一定是非常美丽的舞蹈。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Go back to land again," the Mock Turtle said. "And the first part of the dance is over."<br>
            Both creatures had been jumping around while they described the dance. Now they sat down and looked at Alice.<br>
            She wasn't sure how to react. "It must be a very pretty dance," she finally said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你想看一下吗？”&nbsp;素甲鱼问。<br>
            “好啊！”&nbsp;<br>
            “第一部分没有龙虾也能跳。”&nbsp;素甲鱼对鹰头狮说，“你想唱歌吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你来唱吧！我已经不记得歌词了。”&nbsp;鹰头狮回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Would you like to see some of it?" the Mock Turtle asked.<br>
            "Oh yes!"<br>
            "We can do the first part without lobsters," the Mock Turtle said to the Gryphon. "Do you want to sing?"<br>
            "You should sing! I've forgotten the words," the Gryphon replied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是，素甲鱼唱了一首关于蜗牛跳龙虾舞的歌。&nbsp;两只动物开始跳舞，有时候还不小心踩到她的脚。他们跳完以后，爱丽丝鼓了鼓掌。<br>
            “现在我们想听听你的故事。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。他和素甲鱼分别坐在了爱丽丝的两边。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So the Mock Turtle sang about a snail doing the lobster dance. The two creatures began to dance, sometimes stepping on Alice's feet by mistake. When they finished dancing, Alice clapped.<br>
            "Now we want to hear about some of your adventures," the Gryphon said. He and the Mock Turtle sat on either side of Alice.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “如果你们真的想听的话……一开始，我跟着一只白兔掉进了兔子洞。”&nbsp;她开始讲自己的故事。当她讲到毛毛虫的时候，鹰头狮和素甲鱼已经听烦了。<br>
            “我听够了。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, if you're sure you want to hear my story . . . First, I chased the White Rabbit and fell down the rabbit hole," she began. By the time she told them about meeting the Caterpillar, they looked bored.<br>
            "That's enough of your story," the Gryphon said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但故事还没讲完呢！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。她又一次觉得每个人都很没礼貌。<br>
            “我们再来跳龙虾舞吧！”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。他看着爱丽丝。“或者你想让素甲鱼再唱一首歌？”&nbsp;<br>
            “请再唱一首歌。”&nbsp;爱丽丝迅速回答。鹰头狮皱了皱眉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But I'm not at the end!" Alice said. Once again she thought how rude everyone was.<br>
            "Let's try more of the lobster dance," the Gryphon said. He turned to Alice. "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing another song?"<br>
            "Another song, please," Alice replied quickly. The Gryphon frowned.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哼。”&nbsp;他生气地说，“如果是我，我就不会这么决定，但如果你一定要的话……”&nbsp;鹰头狮看着素甲鱼。“唱‘甲鱼汤’给她听吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            素甲鱼叹了口气，哽咽着唱起歌来。&nbsp;突然，他被一个声音打断：“审判就要开始了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well." He sniffed. "That's not what I'd have chosen. But if that's what you want . . ." The Gryphon looked at the Mock Turtle. "Sing 'Turtle Soup' for her, old fellow."<br>
            The Mock Turtle sighed and began to sing a song in a voice choked with sobs. He was interrupted by a voice calling, "The trial's beginning!"

            “快走！”&nbsp;鹰头狮大喊。他没有等素甲鱼，拉着爱丽丝的手跑了。<br>

            鹰头狮只是重复说了一句：“快走！”&nbsp;他跑得更快了。

            But the Gryphon only repeated, "Come on!" and ran faster.

            爱丽丝和鹰头狮冲进法庭。那里已经聚集了许多动物，还有一整套扑克牌。红心国王和红心王后坐在宝座上。<br>
            红心武士站在他的父母面前。他被戴上了手铐，旁边有两名士兵看着他。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice and the Gryphon rushed into the courtroom. A large crowd of animals had gathered, as well as the whole pack of cards. The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their thrones.<br>
            The Knave of Hearts stood in front of his parents. He was in chains with two soldiers guarding him.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “一定是审判红心武士。”&nbsp;爱丽丝边坐下边对鹰头狮说，“哦，快看！那是白兔。”&nbsp;白兔看上去像是一名法庭官员。他一只手拿着小号，另一只手拿着一卷纸。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It must be the Knave's trial," Alice said to the Gryphon as they sat down. "Oh, look! There's the White Rabbit."<br>
            The White Rabbit seemed to be a court official. Holding a trumpet in one hand, he clutched a scroll of paper in the other.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝看到桌子上有一盘蛋挞。“看到蛋挞我都饿了。”&nbsp;她对鹰头狮说，“真希望审判快点结束，这样我们就能吃蛋挞了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “没那么快。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。<br>
            爱丽丝看了一下法庭。虽然她从来没有去过法庭，但是她曾经读过关于审判的书。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice noticed a dish of tarts on a table. "Those tarts are making me hungry," she said to the Gryphon. "I wish this trial was over, so we could eat the tarts."<br>
            "That won't happen for quite a while," the Gryphon replied.<br>
            Alice looked around the courtroom. Although she'd never been in a courtroom before, she'd read about trials.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “国王戴着一顶长长的假发，所以他是法官。”&nbsp;她自言自语地说，“那边是陪审团，那里的12只动物是陪审员。”&nbsp;陪审员们在写字板上忙碌地写着什么。<br>
            “他们在干嘛？”&nbsp;爱丽丝小声问鹰头狮，“审判还没开始，没什么可写的呀！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The King is wearing a long wig, so he's the judge," she said to herself. "And over there is the jury box, and those 12 creatures are the jurors."<br>
            The jurors were busy writing on slates.<br>
            "What are they doing?" Alice whispered to the Gryphon. "The trial hasn't started, so there's nothing for them to write down!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他们在写自己的名字，这样就不会在审判结束前忘记自己的名字了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么？”&nbsp;爱丽丝大声说，“一群傻子！”&nbsp;<br>
            白兔大喊：“肃静！”&nbsp;于是爱丽丝安静了下来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They're writing their names. They don't want to forget their names before the end of the trial."<br>
            "What?" Alice said in a loud voice. "Stupid creatures!"<br>
            The White Rabbit cried, "Silence in the court!" so Alice stopped talking.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王戴上眼镜，看看谁还在说话。爱丽丝保持安静。她可以从座位上看到陪审员写下了&nbsp;“一群傻子！”&nbsp;<br>
            “还没到审判结束，他们的写字板就会写满了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。<br>
            “白兔，请告诉我们囚犯被指控的罪行。”&nbsp;国王说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The King put on his glasses and looked around to see who was still talking. Alice stayed quiet. From her seat, she could see the jurors writing, "Stupid creatures!"<br>
            "Their slates will be full before the trial starts," Alice thought.<br>
            "White Rabbit, tell us what the prisoner is accused of," the King said.

            白兔吹了三次小号。然后，他展开纸，读了起来：<br>

            红心王后做了蛋挞，<br>

            The White Rabbit blew three blasts on his trumpet. Then he unrolled his scroll and began to read: <br>

            The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br>
            All on a summer day.<br>
            The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,<br>

            “传第一个证人。”&nbsp;国王说。<br>
            白兔又吹了三次小号。“第一个证人！”&nbsp;他喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What is your verdict?" the King asked the jury.<br>
            "Not yet!" the White Rabbit said. "We need to hear from the witnesses."<br>
            "Call the first witness," the King said.<br>
            The White Rabbit blew three more blasts on his trumpet. "First witness!" he called.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            第一个证人是疯帽子。他来的时候，一只手拿着茶杯，另一只手拿着面包和黄油。“不好意思，陛下，我把吃的带过来了。”&nbsp;他说，“我还没喝完茶就被传来了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你应该喝完的。”&nbsp;国王说，“你是什么时候开始喝的？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The first witness was the Hatter. He arrived with a teacup in one hand and bread and butter in the other.<br>
            "I beg your pardon for bringing these, Your Majesty," he said. "But I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for."<br>
            "You should have finished your tea," the King said. "When did you begin drinking it?"

            “16号。”&nbsp;睡鼠说。<br>
            “记下来。”&nbsp;国王对陪审团说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Hatter looked at the March Hare and the Dormouse, who had followed him in.<br>
            "I think it was March 14th," the Hatter said.<br>
            "Fifteenth," the March Hare said.<br>
            "Sixteenth," the Dormouse said.<br>
            "Write that down," the King said to the jury.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            陪审团的动物们赶紧把三个日期记了下来。然后，他们把三个数字加起来，再除以五。这时，王后戴上了眼镜。她盯着疯帽子看，疯帽子的脸色发白。<br>
            “告诉我们你的故事，不要紧张。”&nbsp;国王对疯帽子说，“要不然，我会砍掉你的头。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The creatures in the jury box eagerly wrote down all three dates. Then they added them together and divided by five. Meanwhile the Queen put on her glasses. She stared at the Hatter, who turned pale.<br>
            "Tell your story, and don't be nervous," the King said to the Hatter. "Or I'll have your head cut off."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王的话让疯帽子变得更加紧张，他把茶杯当成面包咬了下去。<br>
            就在这时，爱丽丝有一种奇怪的感觉。“怎么回事？”&nbsp;爱丽丝想。但她很快就明白发生了什么。“我又开始变大了。可是那些蛋挞我还一口都没吃呢！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The King's words had made the Hatter more nervous, and he took a bite from his teacup instead of his bread.<br>
            Just then Alice felt a strange sensation. "What's going on?" she thought. But then she realized what was happening. "I'm growing again, and I haven't even eaten a bite of those tarts!"

            睡鼠坐到了爱丽丝的旁边。爱丽丝开始变大，她觉得自己应该赶快离开，但她又对审判过程很好奇。于是她决定，只要还有空间，就不走。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Dormouse came and sat next to Alice. As Alice began to grow, she thought she should leave the courtroom. But she was curious about the trial. So she decided to stay for as long as there was room for her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你可以不挤我吗？”&nbsp;睡鼠抱怨说。<br>

            “我控制不了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我在变大。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你没有权利在这里变大！”&nbsp;睡鼠说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can you stop squeezing me?" the Dormouse complained to Alice.<br>
            "I can hardly breathe," the Gryphon said.<br>
            "I can't help it," Alice said. "I'm growing."<br>
            "Well, you have no right to grow here!" the Dormouse said.

    </div>
    <div>

            睡鼠的话让爱丽丝很生气。“胡说！你知道你自己也在变大。”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            “是的，但是他没有一下子变大。”&nbsp;鹰头狮说。他和睡鼠站起来，走到法庭的另一边坐下。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Dormouse's comment annoyed Alice. "Don't talk nonsense. You know that you're growing too," she said.<br>
            "Yes, but he doesn't do it all at once," the Gryphon said. The Dormouse and he got up and sat on the other side of the courtroom.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            与此同时，王后一直盯着疯帽子看。她挥挥手，叫了一名士兵。“把上次演唱会的歌手名单给我拿过来。”&nbsp;她说。疯帽子听到这句话，又开始发抖。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Meanwhile the Queen kept staring at the Hatter. She waved to one of the soldiers. "Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert," she said.<br>
            When the Hatter heard this, he started to shake again.<br>
            "Tell us your story right now," the King said angrily. "Or I'll have you put to death."

            “陛下，请原谅我这个可怜的人吧！”&nbsp;疯帽子用颤抖的声音说，“我只是坐下来喝茶，然后茶会闪光……”&nbsp;<br>
            “什么会闪光？”&nbsp;国王问。<br>
            “茶，我们开始喝茶，然后……”&nbsp;疯帽子回答。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm a poor man, Your Majesty." The Hatter spoke in a shaky voice. "I'd just sat down for tea. And then there was the twinkling of tea . . ."<br>
            "The twinkling of what?" the King asked.<br>
            "The tea. We started to drink tea, then . . ." the Hatter replied.

            “我没说！”&nbsp;三月兔打断他说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I know you were drinking tea. I'm not stupid!" The King was growing more impatient every moment. "Go on with your story."<br>
            "After the tea twinkled, the March Hare said . . ."<br>
            "I didn't!" the March Hare interrupted.

            “然后睡鼠说……”&nbsp;疯帽子紧张地看着睡鼠，以为他也会否认所有事情，但是睡鼠已经睡着了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice looked at the jury box. All the jurors crossed out "I deny it" on their slates.<br>

            "Well, then the Dormouse said . . . " The Hatter looked anxiously at the Dormouse, expecting him to deny everything too. But the Dormouse was fast asleep.

            “哇哦！”&nbsp;一只豚鼠欢呼了起来。一名士兵马上过来，把他带走了。<br>
            “如果你只知道这些，那就退下吧！”&nbsp;国王对疯帽子说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">

            "Woo-hoo!" Here the second guinea pig cheered. A soldier immediately took it away.<br>
            "If that's all you know, you may leave!" the King said to the Hatter.

            “你可以走了。”&nbsp;国王说。<br>
            疯帽子从法庭里冲了出去。

            And here the other guinea pig cheered and was removed from the jury box.<br>
            "I'd rather finish my tea first," the Hatter said. He shot a quick look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.<br>
            "You may go," the King said.<br>

            Alice was correct. The Cook entered the courtroom, carrying her pepper shaker.<br>
            "Tell us your story!" the King commanded.

            “我拒绝！”&nbsp;厨师双臂交叉。<br>
            国王不知道该怎么办。他看了看白兔，寻求建议。<br>
            “陛下，您必须让证人讲述事情的经过。”&nbsp;白兔说，“红心武士被指控偷了王后的蛋挞，而这个女人是一名厨师，她最了解蛋挞了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, I refuse!" The Cook crossed her arms.<br>
            The King didn't know what to do. He looked at the White Rabbit for advice.<br>
            "Your Majesty, you must get this witness to tell her story," the White Rabbit said. "The Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. This woman is a cook. She knows all about tarts."

            “那没办法了。非那样做不可的话，我就只能那样做了。”&nbsp;国王说。他对着厨师皱眉。就这样过了很长一段时间。最后他问：“蛋挞是用什么做的？”&nbsp;<br>
            “主要是胡椒粉。”&nbsp;厨师说。<br>
            “糖浆。”&nbsp;她身后传来一个困倦的声音。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Then there's no other way. If I must, then I must," the King said. Then he frowned at the Cook for a long time. Finally he said, "What are tarts made of?"<br>
            "Mostly pepper," the Cook said.<br>
            "Molasses," said a sleepy voice behind her.

            "Seize that Dormouse!" the Queen shrieked. "Remove that Dormouse from court! Off with his head! Off with his whiskers!"<br>
            For a few minutes, the whole courtroom was in confusion as the Dormouse was removed. By the time everyone settled down again, the Cook had disappeared.

            “不用再管那个厨师了。”&nbsp;国王放松了一些。因为他不需要再应对那个厨师了。“说真的，亲爱的。”&nbsp;他悄悄地对王后说，“下一个证人应该你来问。应对这些人，我的头都痛了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “不行，这是你的工作。”&nbsp;王后坚定地说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Forget about the Cook." The King sounded relieved that he didn't have to deal with her anymore. "Really, my dear," he whispered to the Queen. "You must question the next witness. Dealing with all these people is making my head hurt."<br>
            "No, it's your job," the Queen said firmly.

            “哦，对不起！”&nbsp;爱丽丝大叫。上个星期她打翻了一缸金鱼。现在这让她想起了那件事。她觉得自己应该马上把陪审员们放回去，要不然他们会死的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Here!" Alice leaped to her feet. But she forgot how large she'd grown. She knocked over the jury box, and all the jurors tumbled out.<br>
            "Oh, I'm so sorry!" Alice cried. Last week she'd knocked over a bowl of goldfish. This accident reminded her of that. She felt as if she had to put the jurors back quickly, or they'd die.

            爱丽丝开始把陪审员们放回去。她发现一只蜥蜴被放倒了，于是她重新把蜥蜴放好。“把陪审员放回去这事儿真可笑。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想，“这些陪审员对审判一点儿用都没有。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The King scowled at Alice. "This trial cannot go on until the jurors are back in their proper places."<br>
            Alice began working on it. But then she realized she'd put a lizard in upside down, so she put the creature right side up. "Putting the jurors back is actually very silly," Alice thought. "None of these creatures will be much help at this trial."

            “什么都不知道。”&nbsp;爱丽丝回答。<br>

            The jurors' slates were found and returned to them. Except the lizard, all the jurors began to write about the accident. The lizard just stared at the ceiling.<br>

            "Nothing," Alice replied.<br>
            "Nothing at all?" the King asked.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For a few minutes, the jurors kept writing on their slates. The King wrote in a notebook. Suddenly he called out, "Silence!" even though no one was talking. He read aloud from his notebook. "'Rule 42: All people more than a mile high must leave the courtroom.'"

            王后想要仔细地看看。“是什么？”&nbsp;

            "You can't ask the jury for a verdict," the White Rabbit explained to the King. "There's more evidence to come." The White Rabbit bent over and picked up a folded piece of paper. "See? This item has just been found on the floor."<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I haven't opened it yet," the White Rabbit said. "Perhaps it's a letter written by the Knave to somebody."<br>

            "To whom is it addressed?" one juror asked.<br>
            "It's not addressed to anyone." The White Rabbit unfolded the paper as he spoke. "In fact, there's nothing written on the outside. Oh, it isn't a letter after all. It's a poem."

    </div>
    <div>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Is it written in the prisoner's handwriting?" another juror asked.<br>
            "No, it's not, and I find that very strange," the White Rabbit said.<br>
            "The Knave must have imitated someone else's handwriting," the King said.<br>
            The Knave sighed. "I didn't write the poem, Your Majesty. And no one can prove that I did. Is there a name signed at the end of the poem?"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            白兔仔细地读了读诗，然后摇摇头。“没有，没有看到署名。”&nbsp;<br>
            但是，国王还是不满意。他对武士说：“你没有署名，只会让事情变得更糟糕。很明显，你有什么不好的企图。否则，你会像一个诚实的人一样署名的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After carefully reading the poem, the White Rabbit shook his head. "No, there's no name anywhere."<br>
            But the King was not satisfied. He spoke to the Knave. "You didn't sign the poem, which only makes things worse. You were obviously up to some mischief. Otherwise, you would have signed your name like an honest man."

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone in the courtroom clapped wildly. "That's the first thing the King has said today that makes sense!" one juror said to another.<br>
            "Be quiet!" the Queen said, and everyone settled down. "If the Knave didn't sign the poem, that proves his guilt, so off with . . ."

            “陛下，从哪里开始念呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “从开头开始，”&nbsp;国王说，“一直大声念到最后。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No! That doesn't prove anything at all," Alice interrupted. "You don't even know what the poem is about."<br>
            "Read the poem!" the King commanded the White Rabbit.<br>
            "Where shall I begin, Your Majesty?"<br>
            "Begin at the beginning," the King said. "And keep reading aloud until you get to the end."

    </div>
    <div>

            白兔照做了。在他念诗的时候，整个法庭都很安静。<br>
            “这是我听过的最荒唐的诗了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝想，“一点儿意义都没有。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And that is exactly what the White Rabbit did. There was dead silence in the courtroom as he read the poem.<br>
            "This is the most ridiculous poem I've ever heard," Alice thought. "It makes no sense at all."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王却有不同的想法。“这是我们今天听到的最重要的证据。”&nbsp;他搓了搓手，“现在陪审团必须作出……”&nbsp;<br>
            “如果陪审团中有人可以解释清楚，我就给他钱。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“我觉得那首诗没有任何意义。”&nbsp;她已经变得很大了，所以她并不害怕国王。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the King had another opinion. "This is the most important evidence we've heard all day." He rubbed his hands together. "Now the jury must decide . . ."<br>
            "If any of them can explain it, I'll give them some money," Alice said. "I don't think that poem means anything." She had grown so large that she wasn't afraid to interrupt the King.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            国王没理她。“陪审团，你们的裁决是什么？”&nbsp;他这句话大约说了二十次。<br>
            “不是这样的！”&nbsp;王后说，“先判刑，再问陪审团的意见。”&nbsp;<br>
            “太不合理了！”&nbsp;爱丽丝大声说，“没有人先判刑的。如果陪审团觉得武士没有罪呢？那根本就不需要判刑！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The King ignored her. "Jury, what is your verdict?" he said for about the twentieth time.<br>
            "No, no!" the Queen said. "Tell us the prison sentence first, then the verdict."<br>
            "That's absurd!" Alice said loudly. "No one gives the prison sentence first. What if the jury finds the Knave not guilty? Then there wouldn't even be a sentence!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “肃静！”&nbsp;王后说。她的脸气成了紫色。<br>
            “我不要！”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。<br>
            “砍掉她的头！”&nbsp;王后大声喊道。没有人动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Be quiet!" the Queen said, turning purple with rage.<br>
            "I won't!" Alice said.<br>
            "Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her lungs. Nobody moved.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谁在乎你的想法？”&nbsp;爱丽丝说。这时，她已经变成了原来的大小。“你们只不过是扑克牌而已！”&nbsp;<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Who cares what you think?" Alice said. By this time, she had grown back to her full size. "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"<br>

            “有一个爱生气的王后。”&nbsp;爱丽丝说，“如果有人犯了一点点的错误，她就会喊&nbsp;‘砍掉他的头！’&nbsp;她甚至还对我喊&nbsp;‘砍掉她的头！’”&nbsp;<br>
            “你做错了什么？”&nbsp;夏洛特问。<br>
            “我不太记得了。”&nbsp;爱丽丝笑着说，“但是，我可以告诉你我记得的部分。”&nbsp;

            "There was a queen who was always angry," Alice said. "If anyone did the slightest thing wrong, she shouted, 'Off with his head!' She even shouted, 'Off with her head!' at me!"<br>
            "What did you do wrong?" Charlotte asked.<br>
            "I don't remember exactly." Alice laughed. "But let me tell you more of what I do remember."

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝讲完了故事。<br>
            “真是个奇怪的梦。”&nbsp;夏洛特说，“还好你没有真的掉到那个兔子洞里面。现在你该回去喝茶了。很晚了，快去吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice finished her story.<br>
            "That was a very strange dream," Charlotte said. "I'm glad you didn't really fall down that rabbit hole. But now it's time for you to run inside and have your tea. It's getting late, so off you go!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱丽丝站起来，跑了。一路上还想着她那个奇怪的梦。<br>
            夏洛特留在河边。她看着日落，想着爱丽丝的冒险故事。很快，她也开始做梦了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Alice got up and ran off, thinking about her amazing dream all the way home.<br>
            But Charlotte stayed by the river, watching the sunset and thinking of Alice's adventures. Soon she began to dream too.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她先梦到了爱丽丝小的时候，夏洛特记得爱丽丝的声音和她头发的样子，她的头发总是垂到眼睛上，然后她听到爱丽丝的声音，和今天的一模一样。接着，爱丽丝梦里的动物们出现在河岸上，河岸变得热闹起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            First, she dreamed about Alice as a little girl. Charlotte remembered Alice's voice and how she wore her hair. It was always falling in her eyes. Then she heard Alice's voice as it sounded today. After that the riverbank began to come alive with creatures from Alice's dream.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            白兔跑了过去，长长的草在夏洛特的脚下发出沙沙的声音。老鼠在眼泪池里拍打着水花。夏洛特可以听到三月兔和他的朋友聊天时茶杯的响声。红心王后喊着&nbsp;“砍掉他的头&nbsp;！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The long grass rustled at Charlotte's feet as the White Rabbit rushed past. The Mouse splashed through the pool of tears. Charlotte could hear the teacups rattling as the March Hare and his friends talked. The Queen of Hearts kept shouting, "Off with his head!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            猪躺在公爵夫人的大腿上打喷嚏。素甲鱼边叹气边哭泣。<br>
            夏洛特继续在河边打瞌睡。“爱丽丝的仙境感觉好真实啊！”&nbsp;她想，“如果我睁开眼睛，我就会知道这些声音是怎么来的了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The pig was sneezing on the Duchess' lap. And the Mock Turtle sighed and sobbed.<br>
            Charlotte continued to doze by the river. "Alice's Wonderland feels so real," she thought. "But if I open my eyes, there will be an explanation for all these sounds."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她知道是风吹动了草，不是白兔。一只鸭子在河里游泳，不是老鼠。茶杯的响声其实是羊身上的铃声。素甲鱼的叹气声和哭泣声其实是远处牛的哞哞声。其它的声音也都是从附近的农场传来的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She knew that the wind was rustling the grass, not the White Rabbit. A bird was splashing in the river, not the Mouse. The rattling teacups were actually sheep bells. The Mock Turtle's sighs and sobs were cattle mooing in the distance. All the other sounds came from a nearby farm.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，夏洛特梦到自己的妹妹长大了。她看到爱丽丝成为了一个还保有童心的大人。爱丽丝把孩子们叫到身边，给他们讲有趣的故事。有些故事讲的是她童年的夏天，而有些故事则讲的是她在仙境里的神奇冒险。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally Charlotte dreamed about her little sister growing into an adult. She saw Alice as a grown woman who kept the loving heart of a child. Alice was gathering children around her and telling them many delightful stories. Some tales were about the happy summer days of her childhood. And others were about her adventures in Wonderland.
