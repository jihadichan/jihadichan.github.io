        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在宽广的海底，有一个世界叫海底王国。这个王国在大海深处，是连锚都不能到达的海底深处。深到陆地上的人们也不可能到访。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At the bottom of the wide ocean is a world called the Sea Kingdom. This kingdom lies at the deepest part of the ocean, deeper than any anchor can go. It is so deep that humans who live on land can never visit.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在海底王国，到处都是蓝色的海水。那里的水像海面的波浪一样起伏。当大海很平静时，阳光照到这个深处。在安静的夜晚，月亮和星星发出的白光会在水中闪闪发光。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the Sea Kingdom, blue water covers everything. The water there moves like the waves above. When the ocean is calm, the sun’s rays reach down to this deep place. On a still night, white light from the moon and stars sparkles in the water.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            海底生长着最美丽的树。有的树有紫色的树枝和绿色的叶子。那里还有五颜六色的花园。植物都随着波浪慢慢地摇摆。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The most beautiful trees grow at the bottom of the sea. Some have purple branches and green leaves. There are gardens with many brightly colored flowers too. The plants all slowly sway with wave.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            各种大大小小的鱼在叶子和花儿之间游来游去。它们整天玩儿，睡在岩石之间。<br>
            人鱼们住在海底王国里，他们有男的也有女的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Many kinds of fish, large and small, swim among the leaves and the flowers. They play all day and sleep in cracks in rocks.<br>
            Merpeople live in the Sea Kingdom, and there are mermen and mermaids.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            人鱼们喜欢跟鱼朋友们一起玩儿。美人鱼也喜欢用她们美丽的双手喂鱼。像鱼儿朋友们一样，人鱼们也有尾巴帮他们游泳。人鱼们爱大海和里面的一切。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Merpeople love to play with their fish friends. The mermaids also love to feed the fish from their pretty hands. Like their fish friends, the merpeople have tails to help them swim. The merpeople love the ocean and everything in it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们从来没想过去别的地方生活。他们能活很长时间，大概三百年。人鱼们在花园里唱歌、玩儿，幸福地度过每一天。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They have never thought about going somewhere else to live. And they live a very long time—about three hundred years. The merpeople are happy to spend their days singing and playing in the gardens.

            很久以前，一个国王住在大海最深处的一座王宫里。他和他的六个女儿生活在一起。他的王宫有亮橙色的珊瑚墙。黑色的贝壳覆盖着屋顶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A long time ago, a king lived in a palace at the deepest part of the sea. He lived with his six young daughters. His palace bright orange coral walls. Black clams covered the roof.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            黑色贝壳随着潮水的变化开合。贝壳打开时，里面都会有一颗发光的银色珍珠。<br>
            海底国王很善良，统治着水底的所有生物。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The black clams opened and closed with the changing of the tide. Whenever a shell was open, there was a silver pearl inside.           <br>
            The Sea King was kind and ruled over all the creatures underwater.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他希望大家都幸福。但是，他过得很伤心。<br>
            “我好伤心，我的妻子——王后，很多年前去世了。”&nbsp;他叹了口气，“现在，我一个人照顾六个女儿。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He wanted everyone to be happy, but he was living in sadness.<br>
            “How sad that my wife, the Queen, died long  ago.” He sighed. “Now I care for my six daughters all by myself.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不，你不是一个人。”&nbsp;他的妈妈——智慧人鱼说，“我也在照顾她们。还有我让这个王宫保持整洁、干净。儿子，你总是忘记我在这里做的一切！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “No, you're not alone,” said his mother, the Wise Mermaid. “I take care of them too. And I'm keeping the palace clean and tidy. Son, you always forget about everything I do around here!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “您说的对，妈妈。”&nbsp;海底国王笑着说，“这个家幸亏有您。”&nbsp;<br>
            智慧人鱼对整个世界很了解。她把她的孙女们教得很好。“等你们准备好了，”&nbsp;她总是这样告诉公主们，“我会告诉你们关于地上世界的生活。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You are right, Mother,” said the Sea King with a smile. “This family is very lucky that you are here.”<br>
            The Wise Mermaid knew a lot about every world. And she taught her granddaughters well. “When you are ready, I will teach you about life in the Upper World,” she always told the princesses.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            姐妹们各差一岁。当每个公主满十五岁时，她就可以游到海面上去。那时，那个公主就第一次看到地上世界。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The sisters were each born one year apart. When each princess turned 15, she could swim up to the sea surface. That was the first time the  princess would see the Upper World.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            公主们觉得海底王国的生活简单、幸福。她们每天都很开心，笑声不断。可是，最小的妹妹不一样。她很安静，爱思考，有点独特。因为她是年纪最小、身材最小的，大家都叫她小美人鱼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The princesses felt happy with their simple lives in the Sea Kingdom. Every one of their days was spent in fun and laughter. But the youngest princess was different. That she was quiet and  thoughtful was a bit unusual. Because she was the youngest and the smallest, they called her the Little Mermaid.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每个公主都拥有自己的小花园。一个公主把她的花园做成了鲸鱼的样子。另一个公主把她的花园做成了贝壳的样子。公主们在花园里放满了她们在沉船里找到的奇怪东西。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Each princess had her own small flower garden. One princess made her flower garden in the shape of a whale. Another princess made her garden in the shape of a shell. The princesses filled their gardens with odd things they had found in sunken ships.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，小美人鱼的花园很简单。只有红色的花和一个人类男孩雕像。那个雕像是她妈妈的，小美人鱼很爱它。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the Little Mermaid’s garden was simple. It had only red flowers and a statue of a human boy. The statue had been her mother’s, and the Little Mermaid loved it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当姐姐们在她们花园里玩儿的时候，小美人鱼静静地坐在她的花园里。看着那个男孩雕像，她对人类和地上世界充满了好奇。<br>
            “地上世界是什么样子的？”&nbsp;有一天，她问奶奶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When her sisters played in their flower gardens, the Little Mermaid sat quietly in hers. Looking at the statue of the boy, she grew curious about what humans and the Upper World were like. <br>
            “What is the Upper World like?” she asked her grandmother one day.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，小宝贝，那里有很多值得看的！”&nbsp;智慧人鱼说，“那里有树林，当空气变冷时，就会变颜色。很快，树叶就会掉到地上。然后，就会下雪。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, little one, there is so much to see!” said the Wise Mermaid. “There are forests, and when the air turns cold, they change colors. Then, not long after, their leaves fall to the ground. Then snow comes.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “雪？”&nbsp;小美人鱼说，“雪是什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “雪是由小冰花组成的。”&nbsp;奶奶回答，“在冬天，这些小冰花从天上落下来。但是在夏天，绿草覆盖土地，到处充满了浓郁的花香。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Snow?” asked the Little Mermaid. “What’s snow?”<br>
            “Snow is made of small ice flakes,” replied her grandmother. “In winter these ice flakes fall from the sky. But in summer green grass covers the ground, and the smell of flowers is everywhere.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “听起来很棒。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说，“在这里，我们的树没有变化，花也没有香味。”&nbsp;<br>
            智慧人鱼告诉小美人鱼更多的东西。“在地上世界，你可以仰望天空，清楚地看见太阳、月亮和星星。小鸟在树之间飞来飞去，唱着好听的歌。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “It sounds wonderful,” the Little Mermaid said. “Here our trees never change, and the flowers have no smell at all.”<br>
            The Wise Mermaid let the Little Mermaid know more. “In the Upper World, you can look up in the sky and clearly see the sun, moon, and stars. Birds fly amid the trees, singing lovely songs.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “给我讲讲动物吧，奶奶。”&nbsp;小美人鱼恳求说。<br>
            “就像我说的那样，有些动物飞。但是，很多动物有四条腿，在地上走。人类用两条腿走，他们非常擅长造东西。他们盖了很多房子，房子组成了村庄。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Tell me about the animals, Grandmother,” the Little Mermaid begged.<br>
            “Some animals fly, as I said. But many have four feet and walk on the ground. Humans walk on two feet, and they are very good at making things. They build lots of houses, and the houses form towns.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼想听得更多。“他们也会造船，是吧？”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦，是的，小宝贝。”&nbsp;奶奶说，“不过，你已经知道了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid wanted to hear more. “They also build ships, don’t they?”<br>
            “Oh yes, little one,” her grandmother said. “But you already know that.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道，但是我想听关于人类的事情。他们在上面航海，离我们很近。可是，他们的世界看起来很遥远。”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的，人类跟我们很不一样。”&nbsp;奶奶说，“他们不像人鱼这么长寿。我们能活三百年！但是，人类有灵魂。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I know, but I want to hear about humans. They come so close to us as they sail above. But their world seems so far away.”<br>
            “Yes, humans are very different from us,” said her grandmother. “They don’t live as long as merpeople. We live for three hundred years! But humans have souls.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “灵魂是什么？”&nbsp;小美人鱼问。<br>
            “我也不知道，小宝贝。”&nbsp;奶奶回答，“听说灵魂能永生。但是，人类也不真正了解灵魂是什么。不管它是什么，我觉得它一定很特别。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “What is a soul?” the Little Mermaid asked.<br>
            “I don’t know either, little one,” her grandmother replied. “I have heard a soul can live forever. But humans don’t really know what a soul is either. Whatever it is, I think it must be a very special thing.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我想了解人类的一切！”&nbsp;<br>
            “等你十五岁了，你会知道的。”&nbsp;奶奶说，“你能游到海面上去，看有些船来来往往。”&nbsp;<br>
            “可是，我想现在就去！”&nbsp;小美人鱼恳求说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I want to know everything about humans!” <br>
            ”When you are 15 years old, you will find out,” said her grandmother. “You’ll swim to the surface and you will be able to watch the ships sail by.”<br>
            “But I want to go now!” the Little Mermaid pleaded.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你要有耐心。再过五年，就轮到你了。”&nbsp;奶奶笑着说，“不过，你会发现，宝贝，我们海底的家比别的任何地方都好。”&nbsp;<br>
            几年过去了，姐姐们都去过地上世界。但是，她得等待。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Be patient. In five years, your turn will come,” said her grandmother, smiling. “But you will find, dear, that our home here under the sea is better than any place else.”<br>
            Years passed and the Little Mermaid’s sisters went to the Upper World. But she had to wait.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在晴朗的夜晚，她抬头看着月亮和星星。当一个阴影掠过她们时，她知道那是一艘船从她们头顶开过去。小美人鱼渴望地把胳膊伸向船底。总有一天，她将触摸到地上世界。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So on clear nights, she looked up at the moon and stars. Whenever a shadow passed across them, she knew it was a ship passing overhead. The Little Mermaid longingly stretched her white arms up toward the bottom of the ship. One day she too would touch the Upper World.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the eldest princess turned 15, she spent time near the sea. “I lay on the beach under the moonlight and looked at a distant town,” she told her sisters. “The houses’ lights twinkled, and bells rang softly from a tall tower.”

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next year the second sister came up to the surface at sunset. “I saw golden water and a red sky,” she said. “I saw fluffy purple clouds hanging high overhead. And a flock of white swans flew toward the setting sun.”

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The following year the third sister went deeper into the Upper World. “I swam up a river and saw rolling mountains and woods filled with tall, green trees. I heard birds sing happy songs to their chicks. I even saw humans swimming in the sea without tails!”

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Frightened of the humans, the third sister swam back to the open sea. <br>

            "I saw playful dolphins jumping up and down in the water,” she told her sisters. “Huge whales sprayed water through holes in their backs. In the distance I saw many ships. They were so far away that they looked like seagulls.”

            Now it was the fifth sister's turn. Her birthday was in winter. In winter the sea often turned dark green and storms were strong. Enormous icebergs stuck out of the water.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Some evenings the five older sisters swam up to the surface together. They sat on rocks and sang to the ships. Their voices beautifully rang out to the sky. But when the sailors heard the sisters’ songs, they became frightened.

            The sailors quickly changed the direction of their ships. As the years went by, humans told stories of the singing merpeople. They said merpeople were wicked because they tricked humans.

            They said that foolish sailors loved to hear the merpeople's songs and would sail their boats close. Then their ships would crash into rocks. <br>

            The five princesses eventually lost interest in the Upper World. And they spent less and less time singing to the ships. For the merpeople, there was no place as nice as their home at the bottom of the sea. The Sea Kingdom would always be the best place to live.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The Upper World is so beautiful!" exclaimed the Little Mermaid. <br>
            In the distance, she saw a ship. She swam closer and saw that the ship was standing still in the water. Music was playing, and she saw bright, colorful lights. Sailors moved about on the ship’s deck. They walked around on two legs.

            "Humans?" she said. "How wonderfully strange."<br>

            "It looks like a party!" she said.<br>

            Rockets shot high into the sky and turned into a thousand tiny sparks. The water reflected the sparks, and the entire ocean glowed.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid swam up to the surface and watched. The Prince was the most beautiful of all the humans. He was as beautiful as the statue in her garden. <br>

            她扶着王子的头，手指拨开他湿湿的头发。“你醒醒吧，王子。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说。可是，王子还是没醒过来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There's a tall tower and a big door!!" cried the Little Mermaid.<br>
            She held the Prince’s head and ran her fingers through his wet hair. "Please wake up, my Prince," said the Little Mermaid. But he did not wake up.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你睡觉的时候，阳光会温暖你的。”&nbsp;她深情地说。小美人鱼看着他英俊的脸，亲了亲他的眼皮。“他甚至比我花园里的那个雕像还要帅。”&nbsp;她想，“不过，我的王子是真实的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "As you sleep, the sun will warm you," she lovingly told the Prince. The Little Mermaid stared at his handsome face and then kissed his eyelids. "He looks even more handsome than the statue in my garden," she thought. "But my Prince is real."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，小美人鱼听见一个声音。塔发出巨大的声音。小美人鱼抬头看。“那是教堂的铃声吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            一群少女从大门里走出来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly the Little Mermaid heard a sound. There was a loud noise from the tower. The Little Mermaid looked up. "Could that sound be church bells?"<br>
            A group of young girls came out of the large doors.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她们穿着简洁的白裙，头发用白色的蝴蝶结扎了起来。<br>
            “她们是谁？在这里做什么？”&nbsp;小美人鱼很好奇。<br>
            少女们围坐在长椅上，有说有笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They were dressed in simple, white dresses, and their hair was tied with white ribbons. <br>
            "Who are they? What are they doing here?" wondered the mermaid. <br>
            The girls gathered around the benches and sat, laughing and talking.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不能让人类看见我！”&nbsp;小美人鱼害怕地说，“请多保重，我的王子。”&nbsp;小美人鱼离开了海滩，游向一块岩石。小美人鱼为了不让人类发现，躲在海水泡沫里。然后，她看着海滩。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The humans must not see me!" said the Little Mermaid, fearfully. "Please stay safe, my Prince." The mermaid left the beach and swam to a rock. She hid herself in sea foam so no one would see her. Then she watched the beach.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “看！”&nbsp;一个少女对朋友们喊。虽然她穿着和别的少女一样的衣服，但她更漂亮。她有一双绿色的大眼睛，睫毛又长又黑。她跑向海滩，看着那个年轻人。王子还是一动不动。“过来！我发现了一个人！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Look!" shouted one girl to her friends. Although she was dressed like the others, she was more beautiful. She had big, green eyes and long, dark lashes. She ran to the beach and stared at the young man. The Prince still had not moved. "Come here! I’ve found someone!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            少女碰了碰他的脸，确认他还活着。就在这时，他醒了，对着她笑。<br>
            “哦，梅丹，你发现了什么？”&nbsp;一个少女咯咯笑着问。然后，她们都跑向海滩，围在王子身边。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The girl touched his face to make sure he was real. And at that moment, he woke up and smiled at her. <br>
            "Oh, Maiden, what have you found?" called one giggling girl. Then they all ran down to the beach and gathered around the Prince.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当王子看见围着他的美丽少女们时，他笑得更开心了。可是，他一直看着那个发现他的，被叫做梅丹的少女。“谢谢你救了我。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the Prince saw all the pretty, young girls around him, he smiled happily. But he kept looking at the girl who had found him, who was called Maiden. "Thank you for saving me," he said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他应该谢谢我！”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“是我救了他的命，他却不知道。”&nbsp;<br>
            “去教堂暖暖吧。”&nbsp;梅丹说。她领着他走过去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He should be thanking me!" thought the Little Mermaid. "I saved his life, and he doesn’t even know it." <br>
            "Come inside to get warm," said Maiden. She led the Prince.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            别的少女跟在后面，走进了大门。<br>
            “她们从我身边带走了我的王子。”&nbsp;小美人鱼在岩石后说。如果她会哭，泪水会一滴一滴地落进大海。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The others followed and then went through the big doors.<br>
            "They’re taking my Prince away from me," the Little Mermaid said from behind her rock. If she could have cried, her tears would have fallen one by one into the sea.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，人鱼不会哭，所以没有眼泪掉进汹涌的波涛里。<br>
            “我要回到海底王国的家里去。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说，“但是，我会因为你回来的，我的王子。”&nbsp;说完，她跳进了海里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But merpeople are unable to cry, so no tears fell into the crashing waves.<br>
            "I must go home to the Sea Kingdom," said the Little Mermaid. "But I’ll come back for you, my Prince." After speaking, she dived underwater.<br>

            刚开始，小美人鱼决定把她对王子的爱保密。“我不会告诉任何人。”&nbsp;她想，“如果我不提起他，也许我会忘记他。”&nbsp;可是，她没法想别的事情。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At first, the Little Mermaid decided to keep her love for the Prince a secret. "I must not tell anyone," she thought. "Maybe if I don't speak of him, I might forget about him." But she could think of nothing else.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，她告诉了大姐。<br>

            “哦，不！”&nbsp;大姐大喊，“谁？”&nbsp;<br>
            “他是王子。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说，“可是，我不知道他的王国在哪儿或者他住在哪儿。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally, she told her eldest sister, "I have fallen in love with an Upper World person." <br>
            "Oh no!" cried her sister. "Who?" <br>
            "He is a prince," said the Little Mermaid. "But I don’t know where his kingdom is or where he lives."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大姐把小美人鱼说的话告诉了其他人鱼。很快，一个人鱼就听说了这件事，来看爱上王子的小美人鱼。<br>
            “我知道他住在哪儿。”&nbsp;她告诉公主，“他的王宫在一座山上，就在海边山崖上。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Her sister told other merpeople what the Little Mermaid had said. Soon one mermaid heard the tale and visited the princess, who had fallen in love with the Prince. <br>
            "I know where he lives," the mermaid said. "His palace is on a mountain, just beyond the sea cliffs."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “请带我去那里。”&nbsp;小美人鱼求她。<br>
            “我们没有腿，不能走到他家门口。”&nbsp;那个人鱼说，“可是，我们可以游到山崖边去。从那高高的岩石上，我们能看见一个小阳台。王子有时候会站在那里。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Please take me there," begged the Little Mermaid.<br>
            "We have no legs and cannot walk to his door," the other mermaid said. "But we can swim to the cliffs. From the high rocks, we can see the little balcony where the Prince sometimes stands."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在那个人鱼的带领下，小美人鱼游到了山崖边，爬上了附近的岩石。从那里，她看见一座用金色岩石建成的王宫。一个楼梯从大海延伸到王宫门口。王宫一侧，的确有一个阳台。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            With her guide, the Little Mermaid swam to the cliffs and climbed onto the nearby rocks. From there she saw a palace built of golden stones. A steep stairway led from the ocean to the palace entrance. And sure enough, on one side of the palace was a balcony.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，也许我能看见他！”&nbsp;小美人鱼在一块岩石后远望着说。她一直看着王宫，带她来的人鱼就游走了。<br>
            从那天起，小美人鱼就每天晚上到山崖边去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, maybe I will see him!" cried the Little Mermaid, peering from behind a rock. She kept watching the palace, and the mermaid who had come with the princess swam away.<br>
            From that day on, the Little Mermaid went to the cliffs every evening.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她坐在岩石上等着那个英俊的王子。有时候，她能看见王子一个人站在明亮的月光下。<br>
            “哦，王子！我好想跟你说话。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说，“可是，我够不到你。所以，我要给你唱歌。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She sat on a rock and waited for her handsome Prince. Once in a while, she could see him standing alone in the bright moonlight. <br>
            "Oh, Prince, I want to talk with you," she said. "But I can’t reach you. So I’ll sing to you instead."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼认为王子如果听到她的声音，就能认出她。在海底王国，每个人都说她的嗓子是所有人鱼中最甜美的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid thought the Prince would notice her if he heard her voice. In the Sea Kingdom, everyone said she had the sweetest voice of all the merpeople.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">

            可是，他在陆地上，她在海里。在星光下，海风带走了她的声音。太远了，无法被听到。所以，她只能远望着王子。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But he was on land, and she was in the sea. Under the starlight, the ocean breeze carried her voice away. It was carried away too far away to be heard. So she could only watch the Prince from afar.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有几个晚上，小美人鱼会游到港口，希望能见到他。可是，大多时候，她只能看见渔民们拿着渔网，有说有笑。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Some nights the Little Mermaid would swim to the harbor, hoping to see him on the dock. But most of the time, she saw only fishermen with their nets, talking and laughing.<br>

            海巫婆住在一个黑暗地方的边上，那个地方叫固巴。据说，那里的漩涡能吞噬所有的生物。大部分的人鱼不敢游到那附近。他们听说过可怕的故事，说好奇的人鱼游近固巴，永远也没能再回到家里。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Sea Witch lived at the edge of a dark place called Gooba. It was said that its whirlpools could devour all living things. Most merpeople were afraid to swim there. They’d heard scary stories about curious merpeople who swam too close to Gooba and never returned home.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我小时候，奶奶告诉过我海巫婆的家。”&nbsp;小美人鱼边想边游，“但应该不是那么可怕的。”&nbsp;

            "When I was little, Grandmother told me about the home of the Sea Witch," the Little Mermaid thought as she swam. "But it can’t be that awful."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “停下，公主。”&nbsp;一条小鱼突然大喊，“别去那个可怕的地方。”&nbsp;<br>
            “别担心，小鱼。”&nbsp;小美人鱼说。然后，她心里想：“海巫婆能把我变成人类。她一定能的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Stop, Princess," a small fish suddenly cried. "Do not go to that terrible place."<br>
            "Don’t worry, little fish," said the Little Mermaid. Then she thought to herself, "The Sea Witch can turn me into a human. I just know she can."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爱上了王子的小美人鱼继续游，进入了海巫婆的灰色地带。“海底王国很美，这里却真可怕。”&nbsp;小美人鱼自言自语。没有闪光的白色沙子，这里又暗又粘。到处是淤泥。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid, who had fallen in love with the Prince, swam on and entered the gray territory of the Sea Witch. "The Sea Kingdom is beautiful, but this place is terrible," she said to herself. There was no shiny white sand, and it was dark and slimy. It was muddy everywhere.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “海花在哪儿？”&nbsp;小美人鱼觉得很奇怪，“海草在哪儿？”&nbsp;<br>
            “从固巴出去，公主。”&nbsp;一条蛇从一个洞口嘶嘶地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where are the sea flowers?" the Little Mermaid thought strangely. "Where is the seaweed?" <br>
            "Get out of Gooba, Princess," hissed a snake from the mouth of a cave.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是谁？”&nbsp;小美人鱼害怕地说。<br>
            蛇消失在黑暗的洞里。<br>
            突然，小美人鱼看见转来转去的漩涡。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Who’s that?" asked the Little Mermaid, frightened. <br>
            The snake disappeared into the dark cave. <br>
            Suddenly, the Little Mermaid saw whirlpools twirling around.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            漩涡吞噬了近处的一切。所有东西都被吸进了淤泥里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The whirlpools swallowed up everything nearby. Everything got stuck in the mud.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不害怕。”&nbsp;她对自己说，“我的尾巴很健壮，能让我很容易地避开那种危险。”&nbsp;她游过了一个又一个的漩涡。<br>
            然后，小美人鱼进入了一片泥泞的森林，树上都是干巴巴的树枝。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I am not afraid," the Little Mermaid said to herself. "My tail is strong and I can get away from danger easily." And she swam around the whirlpools in her path one by one. <br>
            Next, the Little Mermaid entered a muddy forest where the tree had bare branches.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每根长树枝上都有小树枝，像手指一样动，抓住附近的一切。树枝上粘着鱼骨头和沉船的碎片。船员们的骷髅挂在树枝上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Each long branch had twigs that moved like fingers to grab anything nearby. Fish bones and pieces of wood from sunken ships. Sailors' skulls too hung from the tree branches.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊，天啊。”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“那些树绝对不会放开抓住的东西！”&nbsp;小美人鱼吓得停了下来。“我想我做不到！”&nbsp;她害怕地说。她的心脏吓得直跳，差点就回头了。可是，她想起了她的王子。“为了我的爱，”&nbsp;她想，“我得继续前进。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh dear," thought the Little Mermaid, "the trees never let go of what they catch!" Terrified, she stopped. "I don’t think I can do this!" she said in fear. Her little heart beat with fear and she almost turned back. But then she remembered her Prince. "For my love," she thought, "I must keep going."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在进入森林之前，小美人鱼把头发扎了起来。然后，她像鱼一样飞快地游了过去。树枝伸出手指要抓她。可是，她太快了。树枝没能抓到她。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Before she entered the forest, the Little Mermaid tied her hair. Then she swam quickly like a nimble fish. The branches stretched out their fingers to grab her. But she was too fast. The branches could not catch her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，她来到大海森林里的空地。胖胖的虫子们站着，长长的蛇四处爬。小美人鱼看见一个用骨头盖的房子。海巫婆坐在前面，用一个贝壳剔着牙。她头发乱蓬蓬的，眼睛像珠子，看起来很吓人。她的脚边有几只青蛙在呱呱地向她叫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally she arrived at a clearing in the sea forest. Fat worms were standing, and long snakes slithered about. The Little Mermaid saw a house made of bones. The Sea Witch was sitting in front, picking her teeth with a seashell. With her tangled hair and beady eyes, she looked horrifying. At her feet sat frogs that croaked at her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “欢迎光临，小美人鱼。我在等你呢。”&nbsp;海巫婆说，“我知道你为什么来这儿。你想变成人类。真的太傻了！”&nbsp;说完，海巫婆大笑起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Welcome, Little Mermaid. I've been waiting for you," said the Sea Witch. "And I know why you are here. You want to be a human. What a very foolish idea!" Then the Sea Witch began to laugh.

            The Sea Witch watched the mermaid closely. "I will prepare a magic potion for you," she said, "It will change your tail into legs and feet." <br>
            "Wonderful!" said the Little Mermaid happily. "With legs, I can walk on land and go near my Prince. Then surely he will fall in love with me!"<br>

            “我是你的真爱。”&nbsp;她想说，“我在海里救了你的命。”&nbsp;可是，她说不出话来。所以，她对王子笑，希望他能明白。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I saw you lying on the rocks," the Prince said. "Who are you and where are you come from?"<br>
            "I am your true love," she wanted to say. "I saved you from the sea." But she could not speak. So she smiled at the Prince, hoping he would understand.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你说吧，别害怕。”&nbsp;王子温柔地说。<br>
            可是，小美人鱼只能看着他。<br>
            “你叫什么名字？”&nbsp;他问。<br>
            小美人鱼说不出话来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Please speak; Don’t be afraid," the Prince said warmly. <br>
            But the Little Mermaid could only look at him.<br>
            "What is your name?" he asked.<br>
            The Little Mermaid could not speak.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，他说：“我不知道你为什么不说话，但你还是需要我的帮助。”&nbsp;王子帮小美人鱼站了起来。就和海巫婆说的一样，小美人鱼每走一步，都非常痛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally he said, "I do not know why you will not speak. But you still need my help." The Prince helped the Little Mermaid stand up. As the Sea Witch had said, every step the Little Mermaid took felt very painful.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但在王子眼里，她看起来很完美。他们穿过大厅时，小美人鱼像云彩一样轻快地走着。<br>
            “你真优雅。”&nbsp;王子边说边带着她走进了自己的房间。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But in the eyes of the Prince, she looked perfect. As they walked through the hall, she walked as lightly as a cloud. <br>
            "How graceful you are," the Prince said as he led her into his rooms.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他让他的仆人拿来一些衣服。“把她打扮成王室的贵宾！”&nbsp;他命令说。然后，他转向她温柔地问：“今天你愿意陪我参加王室的音乐会吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            He asked his servants to bring them some clothes. "Dress her as a guest of the royal palace!" he commanded. Then he turned to her and asked softly, "Will you accompany me to the royal performance today?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼期待地点了点头。仆人给她穿上了一条连衣裙后，王子带着她来到王宫大厅，把她介绍给了父母。<br>
            “你真美！”&nbsp;王后感叹道说，“你从哪儿来？”&nbsp;可是，小美人鱼不能回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid nodded in anticipation. After the servants dressed her in a dress, the Prince took her to the palace hall to introduce her to his parents. <br>
            "How beautiful you are!" exclaimed the Queen. "Where are you come from?" But of course, the Little Mermaid could not answer.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一个高个子女人走进大厅为王子和他的父母表演。她唱得非常甜美，王子高兴地鼓掌。小美人鱼伤心地想：“我曾经唱得更甜美。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A tall woman entered the hall to perform for the Prince and his parents. She sang very sweetly, and the Prince clapped his hands in delight. The Little Mermaid sadly thought, "I used to sing even more sweetly."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，小美人鱼听着听着，她惊讶地发现自己想跳舞。她抬起自己的双臂，优雅的双脚滑过地板。小美人鱼的舞蹈很迷人，她让所有人都着了迷，特别是王子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But as the Little Mermaid listened, she was surprised that she wanted to dance. She lifted her arms, and slid her graceful feet across the floor. The Little Mermaid danced magically, and everyone, especially the Prince, was charmed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你太特别了。”&nbsp;他说，“我会永远把你带在我身边，叫你‘我的小伙伴’。”&nbsp;<br>
            小美人鱼对王子微笑。她的眼睛问：“这是你的承诺吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You are so special," he said. "I will always keep you by my side and call you my little companion."<br>
            The Little Mermaid smiled at him. Her eyes asked, "Is that a promise?"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            随着时间的过去，小美人鱼变成了王子最好的朋友。他走到哪里都带着她。他们一起走过王宫花园，骑马穿过田野。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As time went on, the Little Mermaid became the Prince’s best friend. He took her wherever he went. They walked through the palace gardens and rode on horseback through the fields.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们一起爬上高高的山。虽然她不能跟他说话，但她一直微笑，即使她的脚疼得要命。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They climbed high mountains together. And though she could not speak to him, she kept smiling—even as her feet stung with pain.

            晚上，当别人都睡着了，小美人鱼会登上王宫阳台。在那里，她看见海上的波浪，想起在海底的家人们。有一天晚上，她看见她的姐姐们在远处的海里游泳。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At night, while the others slept, the Little Mermaid went up to the palace balcony. There she watched the waves on the sea and remembered her family beneath it. One night she saw her sisters swimming far away in the sea.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们想念亲爱的小妹妹。”&nbsp;大姐大喊。<br>
            她当然不能回答。但她想：“我也想你们。但是，我要和王子结婚，幸福地生活在地上世界。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We miss our dear little sister," the oldest cried out. <br>
            Of course, the Little Mermaid could not reply. Instead she thought, "I miss you too. But I will marry my Prince and live happily in the Upper World."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当她跟姐姐们挥手时，她们认出了她。她们游近岩石。她伸出双臂，告诉她们，如果她可以，她会拥抱姐姐们。从那以后，她们几乎每晚都来给妹妹唱歌。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When she waved to her sisters, they recognized her. They swam closer to the rocks. She held out her arms to show them she would hug them if she could. From then on they came almost every night to sing to their sister.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有一次，她甚至看见了智慧人鱼。智慧人鱼已经好多年没游到过海面上了。小美人鱼的父亲——海底国王，也和奶奶一起来了。他们也朝她伸出双臂。她的奶奶好像在说：“我们想你，我亲爱的孩子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Once, she even saw the Wise Mermaid. The Wise Mermaid had not been up to the surface in many years. The Little Mermaid's father, the Sea King, also came with her grandmother. They stretched out their hands to her, but they did not come as close as her sisters. Her grandmother seemed to be saying, "We miss you, our dear child."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，小美人鱼还是想得到灵魂，想和王子在一起。<br>
            “我喜欢和你在一起，小伙伴。”&nbsp;王子经常这么说，“你对我来说很宝贵。”&nbsp;可是，王子从来没说过要跟她结婚。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the Little Mermaid wanted a soul and to be with the Prince.<br>
            "I enjoy being with you, my little friend," the Prince would say. "You are very precious to me." But he never spokes about making her his bride.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他好像把我当朋友，但是我要和她结婚。”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“如果他和别人结婚，我就会变成波浪上的泡沫。”&nbsp;她想到那样的命运，她颤抖着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He treats me as his friend, but I must marry him," the Little Mermaid thought. "If he marries someone else, I will turn into foam on the waves." As she shivered thought of that fate, she shook.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有时候，小美人鱼会用眼睛恳求王子：“请爱我吧，我想做你最爱的女人。”&nbsp;当她那么看着他时，王子会用双臂拥抱她，像哥哥一样亲了亲她的额头。但是，小美人鱼希望这能改变。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Sometimes the Little Mermaid begged the Prince with her eyes, "Please love me. I wanted to be the woman you love the most." When she looked at him that way, the Prince would hug her in his arms. He’d kiss her lightly on her forehead like a brother. But the Little Mermaid hoped that this would change.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            有一天，王后对国王说：“王子该结婚了。”&nbsp;她希望王子能跟邻国的一位公主结婚。“我们安排他们见面吧。”&nbsp;她告诉国王。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One day the Queen said to the King, "It is time for the Prince to marry." She hoped that he would marry a princess from a neighboring kingdom. "Let’s arrange for them to meet," she told the king.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当王子听到这个消息，他摇了摇头。“我不想跟那个公主结婚，小伙伴。”&nbsp;他说，“我只会跟我真爱的人结婚。”&nbsp;<br>
            然后，他给小美人鱼讲了他的故事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the Prince heard about this, he shook his head. "I will never marry that princess, my little friend," he said. "I will only marry the person I truly love."<br>
            Then he told the Little Mermaid his story.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “几年前，在暴风雨中，我坐的船沉了，我差点儿死了。幸好我被冲到了海边。当我睁开眼睛，我看见一个少女救了我的命。她的名字叫梅丹。她把我带到了附近的教堂。当我第二天醒过来时，她离开了。虽然我只见过她一面，但她就是我唯一的真爱。除非我找不到她，否则我绝不会结婚。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "A few years ago, I was on a ship that sank in a storm, and I almost died. Luckily I was swept ashore. When I opened my eyes, I saw the girl who had saved my life. Her name is Maiden. She took me to a nearby church. When I awoke the next day, she was gone. Though I saw her only once, that girl is my true love. If I cannot find her, I will never marry."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “可是，是我救了你的！”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“请你试着去理解。”&nbsp;<br>
            但是，王子无法理解，只是对着她微笑。“哦，小伙伴，别因为我的故事而伤心。即使我永远也找不到她，有你在我身边，我也很幸福。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But it was I who saved you!" thought the Little Mermaid. "Please try to understand."<br>
            But the Prince could not understand and only smiled at her. "Oh, my lovely little friend, do not feel sad because of my story. Even if I cannot find her, I am happy with you by my side."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “如果他知道真相该多好啊。”&nbsp;她想，“总有一天，王子会明白我比其他任何人更爱他。然后，到时候他就会跟我结婚的。”&nbsp;<br>
            小美人鱼不得不再忍耐一段时间。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It would be so great if he knew the truth," she thought. "Someday the Prince will realize that I love him more than anyone does. And when the time comes, he will marry me." <br>
            She would have to be patient and wait for a little while longer.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Prince explained the voyage to the Little Mermaid. "This voyage is my parents’ wish. They want me to meet the princess. But you and I know that I will never marry her. After all, she cannot be the girl who saved my life."

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Once again the mermaid thought, "It's sad that he doesn’t know I saved him." <br>

            The Little Mermaid looked up and smiled at him. "Maybe I will marry the Prince after all," she thought. And for the moment, she was happy.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid boarded the ship following the prince. That night, while everyone slept, the Little Mermaid sat on deck, gazing at the sea. She thought she saw her whole family on the sea, and they seemed to be calling to her to come home.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone gathered in the hall. They all wanted to get a good look at the princess. The Little Mermaid was very curious too, and pushed through the crowd. Finally, the princess appeared. She was tall, elegant, and wearing a white dress.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “她真的很漂亮。”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“她看起来还很眼熟。”&nbsp;公主的皮肤白皙、透明。她黑色的头发又长又亮。她长长的深色睫毛下，有一双深绿的眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "She is truly beautiful," thought the Little Mermaid. "And she looks a bit familiar." The princess’s skin was pale and clear. Her black hair was long and shiny. She had dark green eyes under her long, dark lashes.

            The Little Mermaid thought, "I’m glad my Prince is not interested in marrying her." <br>

            王子的话深深地伤害了小美人鱼的心。小美人鱼的心碎了。她不能说话，没法告诉王子是自己在暴风雨中救了他。

            The Prince’s words deeply hurt the Little Mermaid’s heart. The Little Mermaid's heart was broken. Unable to speak, she could not tell the Prince she had saved him from the storm.

            The Little Mermaid could not tell him that she would die if he married Maiden. Without a voice, she couldn’t say a single word. <br>

            Though she was sad, the Little Mermaid could not even cry. This is because merpeople cannot cry. She could only look at the Prince with her sad eyes. The Prince didn't know why she was sad.

            "I never thought that I would see Maiden again," he said happily. "My dear little companion, be happy for me."<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Only the Little Mermaid was heartbroken as she held the bride’s flowers during the wedding. She thought about her old life in the Sea Kingdom and her grandmother’s touch.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我抛弃了我的家和家人们。”&nbsp;小美人鱼想，“我失去了我美丽的声音。现在，我失去了我的王子。当太阳在海上升起时，我会死的。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I gave up my home and family," she thought. "I have lost my lovely voice. And now I have lost my Prince. The moment the sun rises over the sea, I will die."

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天晚上，婚宴在大船上举行。王子和他的新娘，还有所有的客人都来到甲板上开大派对。夜晚安静、晴朗，就像小美人鱼第一次见到王子那天一样。五颜六色的灯照亮了甲板。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            That evening the wedding feast was held the grand ship. The Prince, his new bride, and all their guests were on the deck for a huge party. It was a calm, clear night—just like the night the Little Mermaid had first seen the Prince. Colorful lights lit up the deck.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            满天放着烟花。船员和客人们一起随着音乐跳舞。<br>
            王子走向小美人鱼，鞠躬问：“我的小伙伴，你能为我的客人跳舞吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Fireworks filled the sky. Sailors and guests danced together to the music. <br>
            The Prince walked over to the Little Mermaid, bowed, and asked, "My little companion, will you dance for my guests?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我希望我能跟你跳舞，我的王子。”&nbsp;她想说。小美人鱼一个人跳舞跳到了中间。就像平时一样，她双脚疼得要命。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wish I could dance with you, my Prince," she wanted to say. The Little Mermaid danced alone in the middle of the deck. As always her feet hurt terribly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但这次，她不觉得疼，因为她的心碎了。她知道这会是她在地上的最后一晚，她再也见不到她的王子了。小美人鱼得不到灵魂，她会变成波浪上的泡沫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But this time she did not feel the pain because her heart was broken. She knew this would be her last night on earth, and she would never see her Prince again. The Little Mermaid would not get a soul but instead become foam upon the waves.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她跳着舞，像中了魔法，没有思想，没有梦想，也没有希望。小美人鱼的舞蹈很迷人，让客人们着了迷。她的脚好像中了魔法。终于，音乐停止了，小美人鱼也停了下来。她寻找王子，但他已经走了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She danced as if she were under a magic—without thoughts, without dreams, and without hope. The Little Mermaid's dance was so beautiful, the guests were fascinated. Her feet seemed enchanted. Finally, the music stopped, and so did the Little Mermaid. She looked for the Prince, but he had left.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那幸福的夫妇已经去睡了。”&nbsp;一位客人说，好像在回答小美人鱼心中的疑问。“我们祝他们幸福吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            甲板上，有一个金色的帐篷。篷里，王室夫妇坐在床上。客人们欢呼着，王子亲了新娘，手指穿过新娘的头发。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The happy couple has gone to bed," said one of the guests, as if answering the Little Mermaid's thought. "Let us wish them happiness!" <br>
            On the deck, there was a golden tent. Inside the tent, the royal couple sat on a bed. As the guests cheered, the Prince kissed his bride and ran his fingers through her hair.

            派对后，除了小美人鱼，船上的人们都去睡了。她知道自己在日出的时候会变成大海的泡沫。所以，她呆在甲板上，看着大海和星星。“我的王子，我的灵魂和我的未来，现在都没了。”&nbsp;她想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After the party, everyone on board the ship finally went to sleep except the Little Mermaid. She knew that she would turn into sea foam at sunrise. So she stayed on deck and looked out at the sea and the stars. "My Prince, my soul, and my future are all gone now," she thought.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            在太阳升起的几分钟前，小美人鱼发现水里有东西在动。突然，她看见五个人影从海里出来，向她挥手。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A few minutes before the sun rose, the Little Mermaid saw something moving in the water. Suddenly she saw five figures rising from the sea, waving to her.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼没能马上认出来她的姐姐们。她们又长又美的头发不见了。她们一起游近小美人鱼站的地方。她们说话时，她们的头在水面上下浮动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid couldn't recognize her sisters right away. Their long and beautiful hair was gone. Together they swam close to where the Little Mermaid stood. Their heads bobbed in the water as they spoke.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们来这儿救你！”&nbsp;大姐大喊，“我们一听说王子的婚礼，就马上去找海巫婆寻求帮助。”&nbsp;<br>
            二姐解释说：“她给了我们一个魔法匕首，能救你的命。作为交易，她要走了我们的头发。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We’re here to save you!" cried the eldest sister. "When we found out about the Prince’s wedding, we went to the Sea Witch for help right away." <br>
            The second sister explained, "She gave us a magic dagger that will save your life. In exchange, she demanded our hair."

    </div>
    <div>

            三姐告诉小美人鱼海巫婆叫她们做什么。“在太阳升起前，你必须用匕首杀死王子，只要他死了，你就能再变回人鱼。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The third sister told the Little Mermaid what the witch had instructed them to do. "Before the sun rises, you must kill the Prince with this dagger. Once he is dead, you will become a mermaid again."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼颤抖着身体。“可是，我不能杀死我的王子。”&nbsp;她想。<br>
            当小美人鱼犹豫时，四姐接着说：“求你了，妹妹。你必须杀了他救自己。然后，你就能跟我们回家了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid trembled. "But I don’t want to kill my Prince," she thought.<br>
            When the Little Mermaid hesitated, the fourth sister added, "Please, Sister. You must kill him to save yourself. Then you can come home with us."

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The fifth sister spoke for them all. "We all miss you. Our grandmother and father are waiting for you. You belong in the Sea Kingdom." <br>
            "But I wanted my life to be different," the Little Mermaid thought sadly.<br>

            大姐忍不住大喊：“快！你必须要快。天就要亮了。现在就杀了那个王子！”&nbsp;她向空中扔出匕首。小美人鱼很容易地就接住了那把匕首。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The eldest sister yelled impatiently, "Hurry! You must be quick. It’s almost sunrise. Kill the Prince now!" She threw the dagger up into the air. The Little Mermaid caught the dagger easily.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “妹妹，求你快点！”&nbsp;五个人鱼大喊着，潜回了水底。<br>
            小美人鱼看着那把匕首。她不知道该怎么办。这个礼物让姐姐们失去了美丽的头发。她们给了她最后的机会救自己。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Sister, please hurry!" cried the five mermaids as they dived back beneath the waves.<br>
            The Little Mermaid looked at the dagger. She couldn't figure out what to do. This gift had cost her sisters their beautiful hair. They had given her a last chance to save herself.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼走到王子的帐篷前，拉开了门帘。她轻轻地走了进去，看见他的王子搂着他的新娘。他们睡得很沉。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid went up to the Prince's tent and parted the curtains. She stepped lightly inside and saw the Prince hugging his new bride. They were both in a deep sleep.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小美人鱼觉得又恨又爱。透过帐篷薄薄的布，她看见早晨的太阳就要升起来了。没有时间了。她最后的机会就要消失了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid felt both anger and love. Through the thin cloth of the tent, she saw that the morning sun was about to rise. There was no time. Her chance was about to disappear.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她看了看匕首，然后看了看熟睡的王子。要么她活，要么王子活。她把匕首放低，靠近他的心脏，但又停了下来。“我怎么能杀了他呢？”&nbsp;她想，“我爱我的王子。他必须活着，即使我必须死。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid looked at the dagger and then at the sleeping Prince. Either she lived or he lived. She lowered the dagger close to his heart but then stopped. "How can I kill him?" she thought. "I love my Prince. He must live, even if I must die."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所以，小美人鱼跑出帐篷，把匕首扔进了大海。然后，她跳进了大海。她能感觉到她的身体化成了数千个大海泡沫。很快，小美人鱼就不存在了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So the Little Mermaid ran out of the tent and flung the dagger into the waves. Then she jumped into the sea. She thought she could feel her body transforming into thousands of bubbles of sea foam. Soon the Little Mermaid would no longer exist.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The Little Mermaid felt the warmth of the morning sun. To her surprise, she had not died, nor had she turned into sea foam. Instead, she was floating above the water. "It is dawn and I am still alive?" she wondered.

            小美人鱼高兴得有生以来第一次哭了。她幸福的泪水一滴一滴地掉进了下面的大海。<br>

            The Little Mermaid’s joy was so great that she cried for the first time in her life. Her tears of happiness fell drop by drop into the sea below her.          <br>
            Then the Little Mermaid saw the grand ship. Everyone on board was now awake.

            小美人鱼向王子飞吻了一下，飞吻变成了一根白色的羽毛。羽毛向下轻柔地飘落，拂过了王子的脸颊。然后，她又向新娘飞吻了一下。她希望他们俩都过得很好。这是她做的第一件好事。

            The Little Mermaid blew a kiss to the Prince, and the kiss turned into a white feather. It fell down softly, brushing the Prince’s cheek. Then she blew another kiss to his bride. She wished them both well. And this was the Little Mermaid's first good deed.
