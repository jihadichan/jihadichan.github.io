            这天是彼得的十岁生日。爸爸早上去上班了，但姐姐鲍比、妹妹菲利斯还有他的妈妈都送了他礼物。其中一个礼物是一个火车头模型，彼得非常开心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was Peter's tenth birthday. Father was at work in the morning, but his sisters, Bobbie and Phyllis, and his mother all gave him presents in the morning. One of these presents was a model engine, and Peter was overjoyed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            彼得只高兴了三天。因为三天后，火车头突然“砰”&nbsp;的一声，坏掉了。彼得非常伤心。他的姐妹们说他哭了，但是彼得坚持说他的眼睛是因为感冒才变红的。<br>
            那天晚上爸爸回到家，彼得把火车头坏掉的事告诉了爸爸。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter's joy lasted for only three days. This was because three days later, the engine suddenly went bang, and broke. Peter was very unhappy. His sisters said he had cried, but Peter insisted his eyes were red from a cold.  <br>
            When Father came home that evening, Peter told him the story of the broken engine.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爸爸仔细看了看火车头。<br>
            “嗯……”&nbsp;爸爸说。孩子们焦急地等待着。<br>
            “有修好的希望吗？”&nbsp;彼得问。<br>
            “有，有工具就可以修好，但不是今晚。”&nbsp;爸爸愉快地说，“等到星期六，你们帮我一起修吧。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Father looked at the toy engine carefully. <br>
            "Hmm," said Father. The children waited impatiently. <br>
            "Is there any hope?" asked Peter. <br>
            "Yes, it can be fixed with some tools, but not tonight," said Father cheerfully. "Let's wait till Saturday and you can all help me fix it."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “女孩儿也能帮忙修火车头吗？”&nbsp;彼得怀疑地问。<br>
            “当然了！女孩儿和男孩儿一样聪明！”&nbsp;爸爸说，“菲利斯，你想不想当火车司机？”&nbsp;<br>
            “不想。我的脸会总是脏兮兮的。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Can girls help to fix engines?" Peter asked doubtfully.  <br>
            "Of course! Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you forget it!" Father said. "How would you like to be an engine driver, Phyllis?" <br>
            "No, my face would always be dirty," said Phyllis.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我想我想。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“爸爸，我长大能当火车司机吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “可以，我们会帮你的！”&nbsp;爸爸回答说。突然有人敲门。<br>
            “是谁？”&nbsp;爸爸问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I would just love it," said Bobbie. "Father, can I be an engine driver when I grow up?" <br>
            "Yes, we'll help you!" Father replied. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. <br>
            "Who's that?" said Father.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈走进来，说有两位先生来找爸爸。“他们在隔壁的房间里。”&nbsp;她说，“希望他们能快点儿走。孩子们得睡觉了。”&nbsp;<br>
            但是客人们一直待到很晚。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother came in and said that two gentlemen wanted to see Father. "They're in the next room," she said. "I hope they leave soon. The children have to sleep." <br>
            But the visitors stayed until late.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈给孩子们讲了一个绿眼睛公主的故事。可是隔壁很吵，孩子们听不清楚妈妈讲故事的声音。爸爸的声音比平时大，而且听起来很生气。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother told the children a story about a princess with green eyes. But it was noisy in the next room, and it was difficult for the children to listen. Father's voice sounded louder than usual, and he sounded angry.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            女仆露丝走了进来。“夫人，先生让您过去一下。”&nbsp;她对妈妈说，“先生可能有个坏消息要告诉您，请您做好心理准备。”&nbsp;<br>
            妈妈去了隔壁房间，他们又说了一会儿话。<br>
            过了一会儿，妈妈回来了，脸色苍白。“该睡觉了。”&nbsp;她说，“露丝会带你们去睡觉。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Ruth, the maid, came in. "He wants you to go in, ma'am," she said to Mother. " He may have had bad news to tell you, please be ready for the worst." <br>
            Mother went into the next room, and there was more talking. <br>
            Later Mother came back, and her face was pale. "It's bedtime," she said. "Ruth will put you to bed."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但是你答应过我们可以跟爸爸一起晚睡的！”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            “爸爸公司有事，得走了。”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            孩子们亲了亲妈妈，上床睡觉了。鲍比没走，她抱住妈妈，小声说：“有什么坏消息吗，妈妈？有人……去世了吗？”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But you promised we could stay up with Father!" said Phyllis. <br>
            "Father had to leave on business," said Mother.    <br>
            The children kissed her and went to bed. Bobbie lingered. She hugged Mother and whispered, "It wasn't bad news, was it, Mommy? Did someone . . . die?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “没有，没人去世。”&nbsp;妈妈轻轻推开她说。<br>
            第二天早上，孩子们醒来以后发现妈妈不见了。<br>
            “我觉得可能是出什么事了。”&nbsp;彼得一边吃早餐一边说，“我问过露丝，她说我们很快就会知道了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你应该等着问妈妈！”&nbsp;鲍比生气地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Nobody died, no," said Mother, and she gently pushed Bobbie away. <br>
            When the children woke up the next morning, Mother was gone. <br>
            "I think something awful has happened," said Peter during breakfast. "I asked Ruth, and she said we'll find out soon." <br>
            "You should have waited to ask Mother!" Bobbie said angrily.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈到家时，已经是晚上七点了。她看上去很累。她休息了一下，喝了一杯茶，然后说：“孩子们，我有一件事要告诉你们，昨晚确实有一个坏消息。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was seven o'clock in the evening when Mother came home. She looked worn-out. After she rested and had a cup of tea, she said, "My darlings, I want to tell you something. There was bad news last night.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爸爸要离开一段时间。我很担心，希望你们能够帮帮妈妈。乖乖的，不要吵架。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们不知道爸爸为什么要离开。到底发生了什么？
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Father won't be here for some time. I am very worried, and I want you to help me. Be good and do not quarrel." <br>
            The children wondered why Father had to leave. What could have happened?<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们围着妈妈。他们知道爸爸因为公司有事突然离开了，但是为什么妈妈这么伤心呢？爸爸什么时候才能回来呢？<br>
            “这件事就不要再问了。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“对不起，我不能回答。请你们也不要问其他人。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children were gathered around Mother. They had found out Father had to leave suddenly on business. But why was Mother so upset? And when would Father be back?<br>
            "Please don't ask me any questions about this," Mother said. "I'm sorry, but I can't answer them. And please don't ask anyone else either."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            彼得红着脸低下头。<br>
            “答应我，好吗？”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            “我问了露丝。”&nbsp;彼得说，“对不起。”&nbsp;<br>
            “她说了什么？”&nbsp;妈妈问。<br>
            “她说我们很快就会知道了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter looked down, his cheeks flushed. <br>
            "You'll promise, won't you?" said Mother. <br>
            "I asked Ruth," said Peter. "I'm very sorry." <br>
            "What did she say?" Mother asked. <br>
            "She said we would find out soon."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们什么都不需要知道。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“因为这是公事。你们知道什么是公事吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “不知道。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“和政府有关吗？”&nbsp;爸爸在政府部门工作。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You don't need to know anything," said Mother, "because it's about business. Do you understand business?" <br>
            "No," answered Bobbie. "Is it something to do with the government?" Father worked for the government.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“别担心，一切都会好起来的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “妈妈，你也别担心！”&nbsp;菲利斯说，“我们会很乖的！”&nbsp;<br>
            妈妈叹了口气，亲了亲他们。孩子们去睡觉了。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes," said Mother. "And don't you worry, everything will be fine."<br>
            "Don't you worry either, Mother!" said Phyllis. "We'll be as good as gold!" <br>
            Mother sighed and kissed them, and they went to bed.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            接下来的几个星期，妈妈经常出去。艾玛姨妈来了。艾玛姨妈比妈妈大很多。她总是在缝衣服，很无趣。<br>
            孩子们更喜欢和仆人们在一起，因为他们更有趣。如果厨师心情好，还会唱歌给他们听。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Over the next few weeks, Mother was often out. Aunt Emma came to visit. Aunt Emma was much older than Mother. She was always busy sewing clothes and wasn't much fun. <br>
            The children preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing. If the cook was in a good mood, she would sing songs to them.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一天，彼得设计了一个小陷阱&nbsp;。他把一桶面粉放在浴室门上。露丝开门的时候，面粉全洒在她的头上。<br>
            “我会告诉夫人的！”&nbsp;露丝生气地说，“如果你不注意一点，就会跟你爸爸一样！”&nbsp;彼得不知道她在说什么。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One day Peter made a booby trap. He balanced a pail of flour over the bathroom door. When Ruth moved the door, flour fell on her head. <br>
            "I will tell Madam!" Ruth said furiously. "If you don't behave yourself, you'll be just like your father!" <br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一天早上，妈妈下楼来吃早餐。她笑着对孩子们说：“宝贝们，我们要离开这里，去村庄生活了。我们会搬到一个白色的小房子里。你们一定会喜欢的！”&nbsp;<br>
            接下来的一个星期，大家都忙着收拾行李。<br>
            他们打包了碗筷、地毯、锅具和烛台。<br>
            <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One morning Mother came down to breakfast. She smiled. "Now, my darlings," she said. "We're going to leave here, and go and live in the country. We'll move into a little white house. I know you'll love it." <br>
            A busy week followed, with everyone packing up things in boxes. <br>
            They packed crockery and carpets, cookware and candlesticks.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “妈妈，这个要带走吗？”&nbsp;鲍比指着一个漂亮的衣柜问。<br>
            “我们不能带走所有的东西。”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            “可是我们要带走的东西都很难看。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “我们只能带走有用的东西。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“&nbsp;鲍比&nbsp;，我们现在没有那么多钱了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Are you going to take this, Mother?" Bobbie asked. She pointed to a beautiful cabinet. <br>
            "We can't take everything," Mother said. <br>
            "But all the things we are taking are ugly," said Bobbie. <br>
            "We're taking all the useful things," said Mother. "We don't have as much money now, Bobbie."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;第二天，&nbsp;他们出发了。妈妈带着孩子们去了火车站。艾玛姨妈在站台向他们挥手告别。孩子们很开心，因为他们再也不会见到无趣的姨妈了！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day, they departed. Mother took the children to the train station. Aunt Emma waved good-bye from the platform. The children were glad they wouldn't see their boring aunt again!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            火车开了，他们向着新家出发了。一开始，孩子们很开心地一直往窗外看。但天越来越黑，孩子们也越来越困了。后来，妈妈轻轻地叫醒他们，“我们到了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The train departed, and they were going to their new home. At first the children enjoyed looking out the train window. But as dusk came, they grew sleepier and sleepier. Later Mother gently woke them and said, "We're here!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比、菲利斯和彼得在站台上冷得发抖。火车开了，孩子们看着火车离开车站。这是他们在铁路上看到的第一辆火车。他们现在还不知道，铁路很快就会成为对他们来说很特别的东西。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon Bobbie, Phyllis, and Peter stood shivering on the platform. The train left the station. The children watched it go. It was the first train they watched on the railway. They didn't know it yet, but the railway would soon become very special to them.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “走吧。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“我们得走过去。这里没有出租车。”&nbsp;一辆马车载着他们的行李。孩子们和妈妈走在马车后面。晚上又黑又冷，路上都是泥。<br>
            最后妈妈终于说：“我们到了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Come on," said Mother. "We have to walk. There aren't any taxis here." A cart carried their luggage. The children and Mother walked behind the cart. The evening was dark and cold and the road was muddy. <br>
            Finally Mother spoke again. "Here we are."<br>

            孩子们和妈妈看着黑黑的房子。<br>
            “窗户怎么关着？我让维尼夫人打开的。”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            “维尼夫人是谁？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>
            “是我请来帮我们打扫卫生和做晚餐的阿姨。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children and Mother stared at the dark house.<br>
            "Why are the windows closed? I asked Mrs. Viney to open them," Mother said. <br>
            "Who's Mrs. Viney?" asked Bobbie. <br>
            "The woman I asked to clean and make some supper for us."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们走到房子后面。马车嘎吱嘎吱地跟着他们，也停在了后门。孩子们敲了敲门，但没人回答。车夫说维尼夫人可能已经回家了，因为火车到得太晚了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They walked to the back of the house. The clattering cart followed them and stopped at the back door. The children knocked but no one answered. The cart driver said that Mrs. Viney had probably gone home, because the train had arrived very late.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “但是钥匙在她那里！”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            “啊，不过我猜她一定会把钥匙放在门口的台阶下面。”&nbsp;车夫说，“这里人都是这样的。”&nbsp;他把马车上的灯笼拿下来，弯下腰。“真的在这儿！”&nbsp;他拿钥匙打开了门。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "But she has the key!" Mother said. <br>
            "Oh, I'm sure she left it under the doorstep," the cart driver said. "That's what people do around here." He took the lantern off his cart and bent down. "Here it is, sure enough!" He unlocked the door with the key.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            车夫放下灯笼，点亮蜡烛。厨房很大，地面是石头铺的。桌子在中间，椅子、罐子、锅和碗到处都是。<br>
            壁炉里没有火，只有灰。突然墙里传来沙沙的声音。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The cart driver put down his lantern and lit a candle. The kitchen was large, with a stone floor. The table was in the middle. The chairs, pots, pans, and crockery were everywhere. <br>
            There was no fire in the fireplace, just ashes. Suddenly a rustling sound came from inside the walls.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊！什么声音？”&nbsp;女孩儿们大喊。<br>
            “只是老鼠而已。”&nbsp;车夫说。他关上门走了，突然一阵风把蜡烛吹灭了。<br>
            “天呐！”&nbsp;菲利斯说，“我不想住在这里！”&nbsp;她把一把椅子推倒了。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, what's that?" cried the girls. <br>
            "It's only the rats," said the cart driver. He left and shut the door, and a sudden wind blew out the candle. <br>
            "Oh dear," said Phyllis, "I don't want to live here!" And she knocked a chair over.<br>

            “只是老鼠而已！”&nbsp;彼得在黑暗中说。<br>
            “多好玩儿呀！”&nbsp;妈妈说。她摸到了火柴，“肯定是一群可爱的小老鼠！”&nbsp;<br>
            她擦亮火柴，大家互相看着对方。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Only the rats!" said Peter in the dark. <br>
            "What fun!" said Mother. She felt for the matches. "I'm sure they are cute little mice!" <br>
            She struck a match and everyone looked at each other.<br>

            “好了。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“你们不是经常希望发生点儿什么事吗？现在事情已经发生了，我们就把它当作是一次冒险吧！走，我们去尝尝维尼夫人给我们准备的晚餐吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            餐厅在厨房旁边。厨房是白色的。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well," Mother said, "you've often wanted something to happen and now it has. Let's pretend it's an adventure! Let's go and eat the supper Mrs. Viney made." <br>
            The dining room was next to the kitchen. The kitchen was white.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是餐厅从地板到天花板，整个都是用深色的木材做的。餐厅里有桌子和椅子，但是没有晚餐。<br>
            “我们去看看其他房间吧。”&nbsp;妈妈说。他们看了一圈。每个房间都有家具和箱子，但没有吃的东西。就连储存食物的房间里，也只有一个生锈的蛋糕烤盘&nbsp;。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But the dining room was made of dark wood from floor to ceiling. There was a table and chairs, but there was no supper. <br>
            "Let's look in the other rooms," said Mother, and they looked. In each room there were furniture and boxes, but nothing to eat. Even in the pantry there was only a rusty cake tin.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真是个糟糕的女人！”&nbsp;妈妈说，“她拿了钱，却不给我们吃的！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们没有晚餐吃了。”&nbsp;菲利斯伤心地说。<br>
            “别担心，我们有吃的。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“&nbsp;我们带来的箱子中有一个里面有一些吃的。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What a horrible woman!" said Mother. "She's taken the money but got us nothing to eat at all!" <br>
            "Then we can't have any supper," said Phyllis unhappily. <br>
            "Don't worry. We have something to eat," said Mother. "There's some food in one of the boxes we brought."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们都很累，但是因为晚餐很特别，他们又变得开心起来。晚餐有饼干、沙丁鱼、葡萄干和果酱。<br>
            晚餐后，他们铺好床。“晚安，孩子们。”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>

            They were all very tired, but they cheered up at their unusual supper. There were biscuits, sardines, raisins, and jam. <br>
            After supper they made the beds. "Good night, darlings," said Mother.<br>

            "I'm sure there aren't any rats. I'll leave my door open, and if a mouse comes, you can scream. I'll come and tell the mouse to go away!" <br>

            第二天一大早，鲍比拉着菲利斯的头发，叫她起床。<br>
            “起床！”&nbsp;鲍比说，“这里是新家，没有仆人。我们起来给妈妈一个惊喜吧！我们来打扫房子，准备早餐吧！我已经叫醒彼得了。”&nbsp;<br>

            Very early the next morning, Bobbie pulled Phyllis' hair to wake her. <br>
            "Wake up!" Bobbie said. "We're in the new house, and we don't have any servants. Let's get up and surprise Mother! We'll clean up and make breakfast! I've already awakened Peter."<br>

            女孩儿们穿好衣服，然后生起了炉子，烧上了水。她们摆好了桌子，但是找不到合适的盘子。于是，她们把盐放在烟灰缸里，把面包放在烤盘里。做完这些以后，她们和彼得一起来到外面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The girls got dressed, lit the fire, and put the kettle on. They set the table but could not find all the right dishes. So they put salt in an ashtray and bread in a baking tin. After doing those things, they went outside with Peter.

            房子在山坡上，孩子们可以看到很远的地方。山脚下有一条铁路和一条隧道。<br>
            “这里比我们伦敦的家好看多了。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The house stood in a field on a hill, and the children could see a long way. At the bottom of the hill was the railway line and a tunnel. <br>
            "This place is much prettier than our house in London," Phyllis said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            火车站太远了，看不到。“我们去下面看火车吧。”&nbsp;彼得建议说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The station was too far away to see. "Let's go down and watch the trains," suggested Peter. <br>
            "We can see them from here," said Bobbie. "Let's sit down for a bit."

            于是他们三个人坐在一块大石头上。当妈妈八点钟找他们的时候，他们已经在阳光下睡着了。<br>
            孩子们早上生了炉子，烧了水。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis sat down on a big comfortable stone. When Mother came to look for them at eight o'clock, they already fell asleep in the sun.<br>
            The children had made a fire in the morning and boiled water.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是妈妈起床时，炉子已经灭了，水烧干了，水壶也烧焦了。<br>
            “没关系。我都准备好了。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“我找到一个昨天我们没发现的小房间。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But by the time Mother got up, the fire was out. The water had boiled away, and the kettle was burnt. <br>
            "It doesn't matter. I've got everything ready," said Mother. "I found a little room that we missed last night."<br>

    </div>
    <div>

            他们走进厨房旁边的小房间。桌子上有维尼夫人留下来的烤牛肉、面包、黄油、奶酪和苹果派。<br>
            “早餐苹果派！”&nbsp;彼得高兴地大喊。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They went into the small room, which was next to the kitchen. On the table Mrs. Viney had left roast beef, bread, butter, cheese, and apple pie. <br>
            "Pie for breakfast!" cried Peter happily.<br>

            然后，妈妈和孩子们打开行李，开始整理他们的东西。到了快傍晚，妈妈说：“今天就干到这儿吧。晚餐之前我得休息一个小时。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later Mother and the children unpacked and arranged their things in the rooms. It was late in the afternoon when Mother said, "That's enough work for today. I'm going to lie down for an hour, before supper."

            孩子们互相看了看。<br>
            “那我们做什么呢？”&nbsp;鲍比问。虽然她已经知道了答案。<br>
            “我们去铁路边吧！”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children looked at each other. <br>
            "What should we do?" asked Bobbie, although she already knew the answer. <br>
            "Let's go to the railway!" said Peter.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            山脚下有一个木栏杆。孩子们翻了过去。<br>
            他们看到了铁路，包括闪光的铁道、电线杆和信号灯。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At the bottom of the hill there was a wooden fence. The children climbed over it. <br>
            There was the railway, with its shiny tracks, telegraph posts, and signals.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，孩子们听到轰隆隆的声音。一辆火车从隧道里开了出来。轨道上的石头都跳了起来。<br>
            “哦！”&nbsp;鲍比慢慢地说，“它就像一条巨龙经过，用它火热的翅膀扇动着我们。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then the children heard a loud rumbling sound. A train came out of the tunnel. The pebbles on the track rattled. <br>
            "Ooh!" said Bobbie slowly. "It was like a great dragon going by and fanning us with its hot wings."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对。没想到可以离火车这么近，太棒了！”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            “不知道这辆火车是不是开往伦敦的，爸爸在那里。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            “我们去看看吧！”&nbsp;彼得说。他们往火车站跑。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes, I didn't think we'd be able to get so close to the trains! That was amazing!" said Peter. <br>
            "I wonder if the train was going to London. That's where Father is," said Phyllis. <br>
            "Let's find out!" said Peter, and so they ran to the station.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们沿着铁路走，数着电线杆，最后跳到站台上。<br>
            火车站的一边有一大堆煤。煤堆后面有一条白线。彼得问站台工作人员，这个白线是做什么用的。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They walked along the tracks, counted the telegraph posts, and jumped up onto the station platform. <br>
            On one side of the station yard was a huge pile of coal. There was a white line behind the coal. Peter asked the station porter what the line was for.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是为了显示有多少煤。这样，如果有人偷煤，我们就会知道！”&nbsp;工作人员笑着说。<br>
            彼得觉得他很友好。孩子们离开时，一想到很快就会回来，就非常兴奋。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's to show how much coal is there. Then we know if anybody steals some!" the porter said, smiling. <br>
            Peter thought he was a friendly person. When the children left, they were excited at the thought of coming back soon.

            接下来的几个星期，孩子们愉快地开始了他们的户外探险。既然来到了乡下，他们就不用去上学了。妈妈大部分时间都在房间里写故事。因为现在家里穷，她要靠写故事赚钱。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            For the next few weeks, the children happily started their advantures outdoors. Now that they were living in the country, they had stopped going to school. Mother was mostly in her room, writing stories. Because the family was poor now, she needed to sell stories for money.

            The children still had nice clothes and there was enough to eat, so they didn't mind. They did not forget their father, but they had stopped talking about him. They knew such talk made Mother unhappy.

            六月的时候，连下了三天雨。天气很冷，没有人出门。一天，他们来到妈妈的房间。“我们可以生火吗？”&nbsp;鲍比问，“太冷了！”&nbsp;<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不。”&nbsp;彼得说，“我一定要做！有的人会觉得是错的，但我不这么觉得。如果妈妈问我去了哪里，就告诉她我在玩儿一个叫‘挖煤’的游戏。”&nbsp;<br>

            "No," said Peter, "I'm going to do it! Some people might think it's wrong, but I don't think it is. If Mother asks where I am, tell her I'm playing a game called 'coal mining.'" <br>
            Two days later Peter said, "Come quickly, and bring the pram!"<br>

            之前，孩子们在房后的库房里，看到一辆婴儿车。女孩儿们推着车，跟着彼得来到火车站。在火车站旁的山坡上，有一小堆煤。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Earlier they had seen an old pram in a shed behind the house. The girls got it and followed Peter to the train station. On the hill above the station, there was a small pile of coal in the grass. <br>
            "I just found the coal," said Peter. "Help me carry it to the house."<br>

            鲍比、彼得和菲利斯用婴儿车搬了三趟才搬完。他们把煤倒在后门旁边的煤堆里。之后，彼得一个人出去了。他回来的时候身上脏兮兮的，看上去很神秘。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis packed the pram full of coal and made three trips to the house. They put the coal in the pile by the back door. Afterward Peter went out alone. He came back dirty and looking mysterious.

            Peter went out every night, and the children told nobody. A week later Mrs. Viney said that it seemed like there was more coal. The children were very happy—so happy they forgot Peter's actions might be wrong.

            On a quiet night, the stationmaster hid in the shadows. He watched Peter climb onto the coal pile. <br>

            孩子们没有再去火车站，但是他们经常去铁路边。他们很快就认识了所有经过的火车，还给它们起了名字。9点15分的是“绿龙”&nbsp;，10点7分的是“温切斯特虫”&nbsp;。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children stayed away from the station, but they went to the railway often. They soon got to know the trains that passed by and gave names to them. The 9:15 was the "Green Dragon," and the 10:07 was the "Winchester Worm."

            那只手上拿着报纸，是一位老先生的手。他是一位英俊的老人，头发白白的，带着一顶礼帽。孩子们每天都向他挥手，他也挥手回应。<br>

            She sent off many envelopes with stories in them, and she received many envelopes too. Sometimes she opened them and said, "Oh, what should I do?" and the children were sorry.  <br>

            一天，彼得去小镇上买面包时，遇到了站长。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I met the stationmaster yesterday and he said we could go any time we like," Peter replied. <br>
            At the station the children saw Perks, the porter. Unlike some adults, Perks didn't mind answering endless questions, and he also told them many things about the railway.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们知道以前有一个人写下了他看到的每一列火车的号码。彼得觉得他也可以这么做。帕克斯给了他一个信封，彼得在上面写下了379和663。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They learned there was a man who wrote down the number of every train he saw. Peter thought he could do that too. Perks gave him an envelope to write on. Peter wrote down 379 and 663.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天回家以后，彼得向妈妈要一个笔记本。妈妈递给他说：“你们喜欢铁路，我很高兴。但是不要在铁轨上走！”&nbsp;<br>
            “面对火车来的方向也不行吗？”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            “不行！”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later, at home, Peter asked his mother for a notebook. She gave him one and said, "I'm so glad you like the railway. But please don't walk on the tracks!" <br>
            "Not even if we face the way the train is coming?" asked Phyllis. <br>
            "No!" said Mother.<br>

            妈妈诚实地说：“我也走过……那这样吧，你们可以在铁轨上走，但是不能去隧道里或拐角处。”&nbsp;<br>
            孩子们笑了。<br>

        </div>

            Bobbie said, "Mother, didn't you ever walk on the tracks when you were little?" <br>

            "I'll write a letter to the old gentleman and thank him for his kindness," Mother said, hugging them. "You can give it to the stationmaster to give him. And we will forget about this!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            孩子们走出房间以后，鲍比说：“妈妈真好，其他大人生气后都不会道歉的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “是啊。”&nbsp;彼得说，“但是她生气的时候很可怕。”&nbsp;<br>
            他们把信送到了火车站。第二天正好是鲍比的生日。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the children came out of the room, Bobbie said, "Mother is so good. Other grown-ups don't say sorry after they're angry." <br>
            "Yes," agreed Peter, "but it's awful when she's angry."    <br>
            They took the letter to the station. The next day was Bobbie's birthday.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            那天下午，孩子们叫鲍比先去外面，下午茶的时候再回来。<br>
            “你不能偷看，我们会给你一个惊喜。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            鲍比去了花园。她回来的时候，菲利斯和彼得在后门等她，然后带她去前门。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            In the afternoon, the children told Bobbie to stay outside until teatime.<br>
            "No peeking. We will give you a surprise," said Phyllis. <br>
            Bobbie went into the garden. When she came back, Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door and led her to the front room.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们跟平时不一样，收拾得很干净，菲利斯的头上还系着一个红色的蝴蝶结。他们和妈妈一起站在桌子旁边。<br>
            桌子上有12支蜡烛，因为鲍比12岁了。桌子上有面包、果酱和一个大蛋糕。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They were unusually clean, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. They stood with Mother near the table.<br>
            There were 12 lit candles on the table because Bobbie was turning 12. The table held buns and jam and a big cake.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            桌子上还有从花园里采的花，以及几个小礼物。<br>
            “生日快乐，鲍比！”&nbsp;他们开心地大喊，“快打开礼物吧！”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            There were also flowers from the garden, and interesting little packages. <br>
            "Happy Birthday, Bobbie!" they shouted happily. "Open your presents!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            礼物都很棒。菲利斯送了一条精致的手帕。妈妈送了一枚她自己的玫瑰胸针。鲍比想要妈妈这枚胸针很久。维尼夫人送了一个花瓶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They were very nice presents. There was a dainty handkerchief from Phyllis. There was also a silver brooch of Mother's, shaped like a rose. Bobbie had admired it for a long time. Mrs. Viney gave her a vase.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是我送你的礼物。”&nbsp;彼得说。他把火车头玩具放在桌子上。里面装满了糖果。鲍比很惊讶。彼得要把自己最珍贵的火车头送给她？<br>
            “不是火车头。”&nbsp;彼得赶紧说，“只是糖果。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This is my present," said Peter, placing his toy steam engine on the table. It was full of sweets. Bobbie was surprised. Peter was giving her his treasured engine?<br>
            "Not the engine," he said quickly. "Only the sweets."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是彼得看了看鲍比的表情。“我是说，不是整个火车头。如果你愿意的话，可……可以送你一半。”&nbsp;他鼓起勇气说。<br>
            “谢谢你，彼得！”&nbsp;鲍比说，“这个礼物很棒。”&nbsp;<br>
            鲍比心想：“彼得愿意给我一半的火车头，他真好。嗯……那我要坏掉的那一半，然后修好它。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But Peter had seen the look on Bobbie's face. "I mean, not all the engine. You . . . you can have half, if you like," he said bravely. <br>
            "Thanks, Peter!" said Bobbie. "It's a wonderful present." <br>
            And Bobbie thought, "It was very kind of Peter to give me half his engine. Well . . . I'll have the broken half, and I'll get it fixed."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在看看蛋糕吧。”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>
            鲍比仔细看了看蛋糕。蛋糕上有个用花做的图案。<br>
            “这是什么？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>
            “是铁路的地图！”&nbsp;彼得说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And now look at the cake," said Mother. <br>
            Bobbie looked more closely at the cake. On top was something that looked like a pattern, made with flowers. <br>
            "What is it?" asked Bobbie. <br>
            "It's a map of the railway!" said Peter.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            喝完茶，妈妈和他们一起玩游戏。这是一个美好的生日。<br>
            那天晚上，鲍比轻轻地下楼去拿礼物。鲍比看到妈妈坐在桌子旁边，手里拿着一支笔和一些信纸。“妈妈要给爸爸写信。”&nbsp;鲍比想。但是，妈妈一直没有开始写。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After tea Mother played games with them. It was a lovely birthday. <br>
            That night, Bobbie crept downstairs to get her presents. Bobbie saw Mother sitting at the table, with a pen and some writing paper. "She's writing to Father," thought Bobbie. But Mother didn't start writing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈头枕着胳膊，趴在了桌子上。<br>
            “今天是我的生日，妈妈肯定不想让我知道她不开心。”&nbsp;鲍比想。她悄悄地回到自己的房间。美好的生日派对，却是一个伤心的结尾。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother's head rested on her arms on the table. <br>
            "It's my birthday, and she doesn't want me to know she's unhappy," thought Bobbie. She went quietly back to her room. The birthday party was lovely, but had a sad end.<br>

            第二天早上，鲍比想着要偷偷地修好火车头。那天下午，机会来了。妈妈要去附近的小镇买东西。彼得、鲍比和菲利斯陪她一起去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning Bobbie thought about how to get the train engine repaired in secret. The chance came that afternoon. Mother was going to the nearest town to do some shopping. Peter, Bobbie, and Phyllis were accompanying her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比不想去，但她想不到任何借口。他们出发时，鲍比的裙子被门口的钉子勾破了。妈妈说没有时间换裙子了，所以让她留在家里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie didn't want to go, but she couldn't think of any excuse. As they were leaving, her dress caught on a nail by the door. Mother said there was no time to change her dress, so she let her stay at home.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            太好了！鲍比换上一条普通的裙子，来到铁路边。她沿着铁轨走过站台。当她走到平时火车头停靠的地方时，她藏到了旁边的草丛里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Hooray! Bobbie changed into an ordinary dress and went down to the railway. She walked along the tracks and past the platform. When she reached the place where the engines stopped, she hid behind a bush next to it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比用棕色的纸包着玩具火车头。她耐心地等待着。一列火车进站停下以后，她走过去站在火车头旁边。她从来没有离火车头这么近过。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie had the toy engine wrapped up in brown paper. She waited patiently with it. When the next train came in and stopped, she went and stood next to the engine. She had never been so close to an engine before.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            火车司机和添煤工都没有看到她。他们正在和站在铁轨另一边的站台工作人员帕克斯说话。<br>
            “打扰一下。”&nbsp;鲍比说。但是太吵了，他们没有听到。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The engine driver and the stoker did not see her. They were talking to Perks, the porter, who was on the other side of the tracks. <br>
            "Excuse me," began Bobbie. But the men could not hear her because of the noise.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比爬上梯子，想让他们听到自己的声音。就在这时，火车开动了！鲍比掉进了煤堆里。<br>
            “救命啊！救命啊！”&nbsp;她大喊。但是他们没有看到她，也没有听到她的声音。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie climbed onto the engine's step so they could hear her. At that moment the train began to move! Bobbie fell inside, onto a pile of coal. <br>
            "Help! Help!" she cried. But the men still didn't see her or hear her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不应该在这里。”&nbsp;她想。火车越开越快。“这下麻烦大了！”&nbsp;鲍比伸出手，碰到了司机的胳膊，司机赶快转过身来。<br>
            “你在这里干什么？”&nbsp;他大喊。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I shouldn't be here," she thought. The train went faster. "I'll be in big trouble!" Bobbie put out her hand and touched the driver's arm, and the driver turned around quickly. <br>
            "What are you doing here?" he shouted.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比哭了起来，两个男人忙了半天才让鲍比冷静下来。添煤工说：“现在告诉我们你怎么会在这里。并不是每天都有女孩儿掉进我们的火车头里的！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie began to cry. Two men took several minutes to calm Bobbie down and stop her crying. Then the stoker said, "Now, tell us why you're here. It's not every day a little girl tumbles into our steam engine!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比拿出彼得的玩具火车头给他们看。“我……我想问你们能不能修好这个。”&nbsp;她解释说，“铁路上的每个人都很友好，我想你们肯定会帮我的。”&nbsp;<br>
            两个人仔细查看着小火车头。鲍比等待着。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie showed them Peter's toy engine. "I . . . I wanted to ask you if you could fix this," she explained. "Everybody on the railway is so nice. I am sure that you would help me." <br>
            The men examined the little engine. Bobbie waited.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “吉姆，你觉得呢？”&nbsp;司机问，“我们能帮助这个小女孩儿吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            添煤工笑了，“应该可以。”&nbsp;<br>
            “谢谢！”&nbsp;鲍比大声说。<br>
            “现在我们得送你回家了。”&nbsp;司机说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What do you think, Jim?" asked the driver. "Can we help the little lady?" <br>
            The stoker grinned. "I think we can." <br>
            "Thank you!" cried Bobbie. <br>
            "Now we must get you home," said the driver.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比坐到了下一站。两个人把她送到另一列火车上，让她回家。<br>
            “你去哪里了？”&nbsp;菲利斯和彼得问。<br>
            “当然是去了火车站。”&nbsp;鲍比说，但她没说其他的。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie stayed on the train until the next station. The men put her on another train and sent her home. <br>
            "Where have you been?" asked Phyllis and Peter. <br>
            "To the station, of course," said Bobbie. But she would not say another word.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            几个星期后，鲍比拿回了玩具火车头。彼得看到修好的火车头时，非常激动。鲍比把自己的火车头历险故事告诉了他们。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A few weeks later, Bobbie collected the toy engine. Peter was very excited when he saw the fixed engine. Then Bobbie told them about her great engine adventure.

            一天，孩子们沿着铁路边的栏杆走在山坡上。地面上有很多石头，但也长了很多小树和花草。孩子们在找野生的樱桃。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One day the children were walking by the fence along the top of the hill, beside the railway line. The ground was very rocky, but some grass and small trees grew. The children were looking for wild cherries.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，他们听到一个声音。声音很小，但是很清晰。慢慢地，声音越来越大。<br>
            “快看那棵树！”&nbsp;彼得大喊。<br>
            女孩儿们看到一棵树慢慢地从山坡上滑了下来，快要滑到铁路上了！<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly they heard a noise. The noise was soft but very clear, and slowly it began to get louder. <br>
            "Look at the tree over there!" shouted Peter. <br>
            The girls saw a tree moving slowly down the hill. The tree was moving toward the railway line!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是魔法！”&nbsp;菲利斯说，“我就知道这条铁路有魔法！快看，其他树也在移动！”&nbsp;<br>
            确实看上去像是有魔法——所有的树好像都在沿着山坡往下滑！它们发出了巨大的声音。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's magic!" said Phyllis. "I knew the railway was magic! Look, some other trees are moving too!"<br>
            It really did seem like magic—all the trees seemed to be walking down the hillside! A loud rumbling sound filled the air.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好可怕呀。我们回家吧！”&nbsp;菲利斯说。但是他们还是一起看着树从山坡上滑下来。<br>
            接着，一些石头和土也开始松动，落在了下面的铁轨上。一块大石头也滚了下来。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's so scary. Let's go home!" said Phyllis. But they all watched as the trees slipped slowly down the hillside. <br>
            Then some stones and loose earth fell down and fell on the railway tracks below. A big rock began to move too.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “全部都要滑下去了。”&nbsp;彼得想说话，但吓得说不出来。<br>
            更多的石头、草、树和灌木丛从山坡上滑到铁轨上，到处都是灰尘。<br>
            “铁轨被挡住了！”&nbsp;菲利斯大喊。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's all coming down," Peter tried to say, but he was too scared to speak. <br>
            More rocks, grass, trees, and bushes slipped off the hill and crashed onto the tracks below. Dust was everywhere.<br>
            "It's blocked the tracks!" cried Phyllis.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是啊。”&nbsp;彼得说。他在思考。<br>
            “11点29分的火车还没有经过。我们必须让火车站的人知道，不然就会有事故发生。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “没有时间了！”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes," said Peter, thinking. <br>
            "And the 11:29 hasn't gone past yet. We must let them know at the station, or there will be an accident," Bobbie said. <br>
            "There isn't time!" said Phyllis.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在已经过11点了。”&nbsp;彼得说。他们想了一会儿。“我们需要红色的东西来吸引注意力。”&nbsp;彼得说，“这样我们就可以下去向火车挥手。”&nbsp;<br>
            他们开始向山脚下走去。鲍比脸色苍白，菲利斯紧张得脸都红了。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's after eleven now," Peter said. They thought for a moment. "We need something red to get people's attention," said Peter. "Then we could go down and wave to the train." <br>
            They started to walk down the hill. Bobbie was pale, and Phyllis was so nervous that her face turned red.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我好热！”&nbsp;她说，“还以为今天会很冷，早知道不穿……”&nbsp;她突然停了下来，看上去很兴奋。“我们的衬裙！”&nbsp;菲利斯大喊，“衬裙是红色的！我们脱下来吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "How hot I am!" she said. "I thought it was going to be cold. I wish we hadn't put on our . . ." She stopped suddenly and looked excited. "Our petticoats!" Phyllis cried. "They're red! Let's take them off!"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            女孩儿们脱掉衬裙，孩子们跑到铁路拐弯的地方。火车就要来了。<br>

            “你该不会……是要把它撕开吧？”&nbsp;菲利斯问。<br>

            “菲利斯，如果我们不能让火车停下来，就会出事故，有人会死的！”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            彼得把每条衬裙都撕成三片。他又看了看手表，“只有七分钟了，我们还需要一些棍子。”&nbsp;<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Phyllis, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real accident, with people killed!" Bobbie said. <br>
            Peter divided each petticoat into three pieces. Then he looked at his watch again. "We've got seven minutes. We'll need some sticks as well."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们找到一些棍子，把衬裙绑在上面。现在，他们有了六面红色的旗子。孩子们在铁轨两边堆了两堆石头，在每堆石头上都插了一面旗子。菲利斯和鲍比一人拿了一面旗子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They found some sticks and tied the flannel onto them. Now they had six red flags. The children made two little piles of rocks on the tracks, and stuck a flag in each. Then Phyllis and Bobbie each took a flag.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我拿两面，因为是我把衬裙撕开的。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            “但那是我们的衬裙。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            鲍比打断了他们，“这些都不重要！我们要拯救火车！”&nbsp;<br>
            可能是彼得的手表走得慢，也可能是火车来晚了。孩子们觉得等了很久很久。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I will have two flags because I'm the one who tore them," said Peter. <br>
            "They're our petticoats though," Phyllis began to argue. <br>
            Bobbie interrupted.  "Who cares? We have to save the train!" <br>
            Perhaps Peter's watch was slow, or perhaps the train was late. They seemed to wait for a long time.

            It seemed as if the children had been waiting for hours. They held the flags tightly in their hands. They had to warn the train to stop before it came around the bend and crashed into the rocks and trees!

            "Wave your flags!" Peter shouted. "And Bobbie, don't stand on the tracks!"<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie jumped forward, and caught the flag, and waved it. The train came as fast as ever. It was very close now. <br>

            "It's no good!" said Bobbie.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Stand back, Bobbie!" shouted Phyllis.  <br>
            But Bobbie cried, "Not yet, not yet!" and stood right on the tracks. She waved her two flags. The front of the engine looked black and very big. <br>
            "Stop, stop, stop!" cried Bobbie. But no one heard her.

            彼得和菲利斯听不到鲍比的声音。但是鲍比觉得火车应该是听到了，因为它很快就慢了下来，停在离鲍比二十米远的地方。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter and Phyllis didn't hear Bobbie. But afterward Bobbie wondered if the engine had heard her because it slowed down quickly and stopped twenty meters in front of Bobbie.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            鲍比看到巨大的黑火车头停下来了，但她还是不停地挥着旗子。火车司机和添煤工跳下火车。彼得和菲利斯向他们跑去。鲍比动不了，因为她的腿抖得厉害。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie saw the great black engine stop, but she could not stop waving the flags. The engine driver and the fireman jumped off the train. Peter and Phyllis ran to meet them. Bobbie couldn't move because her legs were shaking too much.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当大家回来找鲍比时，她躺在地上，手里还拿着旗子。她晕倒了！火车司机把她抱起来，放在头等车厢的椅子上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the others came back to get Bobbie, she was lying on the ground, still gripping the flags. She had fainted! The engine driver picked her up. He carried her into a first-class car, where he laid her down on the chair.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我觉得人死了就是这个样子。”&nbsp;菲利斯小声说。<br>
            “不要胡说！”&nbsp;彼得严厉地说。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I think that's what people look like when they're dead," Phyllis whispered. <br>
            "Don't say that!" said Peter sharply. <br>
            The train started up again and went back to the station.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            很快，鲍比叹了口气，睁开眼睛。她转身哭了起来。彼得和菲利斯不再担心了。因为他们虽然没有见过她晕倒，但是见过她哭。<br>
            火车到达火车站时，一群人来欢迎鲍比、彼得和菲利斯三位小英雄。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon Bobbie sighed and opened her eyes. Then she rolled over and began to cry. Peter and Phyllis weren't worried any more. Because they had seen her cry before. But they had never seen her faint. <br>
            When the train reached the station, a small crowd of people greeted Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis as heroes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大家夸奖孩子们有勇气，有魄力！<br>
            “你们真是又聪明又勇敢！”&nbsp;火车司机说。<br>
            菲利斯很享受此刻。她从来没有当过英雄。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children were praised for their bravery and courage! <br>
            "You're brave and clever!" the driver said. <br>
            Phyllis enjoyed the attention. She had never been a heroine before.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            彼得的耳朵红了，但是他也很开心。只有鲍比想要赶快离开。<br>
            “火车公司可能会联系你们。”&nbsp;站长说。鲍比不想再听到相关的事了。她拉了拉彼得的夹克。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter's ears got very red, but he was happy. Only Bobbie wished they could all leave at that moment. <br>
            "You'll hear from the train company about this, " the stationmaster said. Bobbie wished she would never hear of it again. She pulled at Peter's jacket.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “走吧，我想回家！”&nbsp;鲍比说。她还在想铁轨上的石堆。如果火车撞到了石堆会发生什么事呢？<br>
            孩子们回家了。他们离开的时候，火车站站长、保安和火车司机们都为他们欢呼。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Come on! I want to go home!" Bobbie said. She kept thinking about the pile of rocks on the track. What would have happened had the train crashed into it?<br>
            The children went home. As the children left the station, the stationmaster, guards, and drivers cheered.

            下午3点，孩子们穿着他们最好的衣服，来到了火车站。站长过来迎接他们。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was to be a special day indeed.<br>
            The children went to the station at three o'clock, dressed in their best clothes. The stationmaster came to meet them. <br>
            "Come into the waiting room," he said.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            今天的候车室看上去很不一样：地上铺着地毯，窗台上摆放着玫瑰花，墙上挂着绿色的树枝。站台工作人员帕克斯和其他几位戴着高帽子的男人站在一边。&nbsp;<br>
            旁边还有几位穿着华丽的女士。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The waiting room looked very different today. There was a carpet on the floor and roses on the windowsills. Green branches hung from the wall. Perks, the porter, was there, as well as several men with tall hats. <br>
            There were ladies in expensive dresses too.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最棒的是，火车上的那位老先生也在那里！他走过来跟孩子们握手。一位看上去很重要的人站了起来，他描述了孩子们勇敢的事迹。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            What made the children happier was the old gentleman from the train was there! He came across the room to shake the children's hands. Then an important-looking man stood up. He spoke about how bravely the children had acted.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            接着，老先生站起来，也说了一些夸奖孩子们的话。接着，他一一叫了孩子们的名字，送给他们每人一只漂亮的金表和一条表链。表里写着一段话。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Next the old gentleman got up and said nice things about the children too. Then he called the children one by one, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain. Inside the watches there was a message.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你非常勇敢！感谢你阻止了一起火车事故！——铁路公司董事会”&nbsp;。<br>
            站长小声对鲍比说：“现在你得说点什么，感谢一下大家。”&nbsp;他轻轻地把鲍比推上前。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            You were very brave. Thank you for stopping a train accident. From the Directors of the Railway Company.<br>
            The stationmaster whispered to Bobbie, "Now you must make a speech and thank everyone," and he gently pushed Bobbie forward.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “天啊。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“女士们，先生们，”&nbsp;她说，“感谢你们送了这么漂亮的怀表，我们有些惭愧，因为我们其实并没有做什么。嗯……那确实是一件让人兴奋又害怕的事情……谢谢大家！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh dear," said Bobbie. "Ladies and gentlemen," she said, "thank you for these lovely watches. We really don't deserve them, because what we did wasn't anything really. Well . . .  it was exciting and frightening . . . thank you all very much!"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            大家都热烈地鼓掌，然后每个人都和孩子们握了手。<br>
            多么美好的一天啊！之后，老先生和他们一起来到他们的白房子。<br>
            “我想见见这么勇敢又聪明的孩子们的妈妈。”&nbsp;他说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The people clapped, and then everybody shook hands with the three children. <br>
            What a wonderful day! Afterward the old gentleman walked with them to their white house. <br>
            "I want to meet the mother of these brave and clever children," he said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈看到客人，非常惊讶！她再次感谢老先生在她生病时送来东西。大家一边喝茶，一边听孩子们讲述在火车站里发生的事情，妈妈还和老先生用了法语和英语聊天。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother was surprised to see their visitor! She thanked the old man again for the things he had sent when she was ill. While they had tea, the children told Mother about the people at the station. Mother and the old gentleman chatted in French and English.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            老先生要离开时，妈妈说：“很高兴见到您，感谢您所做的一切！”&nbsp;孩子们向老先生挥手说再见，就像每天早上他的火车经过时那样。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When it was time for the old gentleman to leave, Mother said, "Lovely to meet you. I want to thank you for everything!" Then the children waved good-bye to the old gentleman. It was just as they did every morning when his train passed by.

            大家在议论着什么，一定是有什么事情发生了。<br>

            Everybody was talking at once. It was clear that something had happened. <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then the stationmaster said loudly, "Everybody, move along!" <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's he saying?" someone asked. <br>
            "Sounds like French to me," said the stationmaster. <br>
            "It isn't French," said Peter. "I know what French sounds like." The crowd parted to see who had spoken, and now Peter could see the man. He wore strange clothes, and had long hair and wild eyes.

            “你会法语，你来跟他聊聊。”&nbsp;一个女人对彼得说。<br>

            "Well, try speaking to the man if you know French," said one lady to Peter. <br>

            “他说什么？”&nbsp;站长问。<br>

            "What's he saying?" the stationmaster asked. <br>
            "I don't know," answered Peter. <br>
            The stationmaster took the man into the waiting room. <br>
            "Mother can speak French," Bobbie said to the stationmaster. "She'll arrive on the next train."

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们和男人一起等待的时候，彼得想到了一个办法。他从口袋里拿出一个信封，里面是各个国家的邮票。<br>
            彼得给男人看意大利的邮票，指了指邮票，又指了指他。但是男人摇了摇头。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As they waited with the man, Peter got an idea. He pulled an envelope out of his pocket. It was full of foreign stamps. <br>
            Peter showed the man an Italian stamp, pointing from the stamp to him. But the man shook his head.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            接着给他看了一张挪威和西班牙的邮票。男人又摇了摇头。最后，男人拿走信封，自己在邮票里找。<br>
            “他是俄国人！”&nbsp;菲利斯看到他拿起一张俄国的邮票。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Next the children showed him a Norwegian stamp and a Spanish stamp. Again the man shook his head. At last he took the envelope and searched among the stamps himself. <br>
            "He's Russian!" Phyllis exclaimed as the man held up a Russian stamp.

            妈妈的火车到站了，站长把她带进候车室。俄国人站起来鞠了个躬。<br>
            妈妈和男人用法语交流。一开始句子比较短，后来句子越来越长。孩子们看着妈妈的表情。他们可以猜到男人在告诉妈妈一件让她又生气又伤心的事。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            By now Mother's train had arrived, and the stationmaster brought her into the waiting room. The Russian stood up and bowed. <br>
            Mother spoke in French and he replied, a little at first, but then in longer sentences. The children watched Mother's face. They could see that he was telling her things that made her angry and sad.

            “不用担心。”&nbsp;妈妈愉快地说，“他在俄国很有名，他写过许多非常棒的书。”&nbsp;<br>

            之后，鲍比带着医生来到房间。在房间里，她看到妈妈黑色的大箱子。平时箱子是锁着的，但是现在是开着的。箱子里有爸爸的衣服。为什么爸爸没有带走衣服？鲍比的心砰砰直跳。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later Bobbie showed the doctor into the room. Inside she spotted Mother's big black suitcase. It was usually locked, but now it was open. Father's clothes were in there. Why hadn't Father taken his clothes? Bobbie's heart was beating horribly.

            孩子们的家附近有一条运河。货船在运河上来来往往。大部分货船上都载着煤。有些货船有发动机，有些货船需要用马拉。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            There was a canal near the children's house. Cargo boats went up and down the canal. Most of the boats carried coal. Some boats had motors and some were pulled by horses. <br>

            但他们更喜欢铁路，主要原因有两个：一个是他们先发现了铁路，另一个是运河上的人不是很友好。<br>
            有一次，孩子们在运河边钓鱼。一个货船上的男孩儿为了找乐子，朝着菲利斯扔了一块煤。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They loved the railway best for two reasons. They had found the railway first, and the people who worked on the canal were unfriendly. <br>
            Once the children had gone fishing in the canal. But a boy on a cargoboat had thrown a piece of coal at Phyllis. He'd done it just for fun.

            When the man had gone, the children climbed down the hill. <br>
            "I think the canal belongs to everyone," Peter said.

            女人下了船，看到了他们。“别把比尔说的话放在心上。”&nbsp;她说，“他就是这样，不过他两个小时后才回来，你们可以继续钓鱼了。”&nbsp;她说。<br>

            The woman got off the boat and saw them. "Don't worry about Bill," she said. "That's who he is. But he'll be back in two hours. You can keep on fishing," she said. <br>
            "Thank you," said Bobbie. "You're kind. Where's your baby?"

            Peter pushed her back. <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was very late, and Mother was very worried about the children. Finally, the children arrived home, and they were soaking wet. They told Mother what had happened, and Mother was pleased. She let them accept Bill's present, a ride on his boat the next day.

            孩子们和帕克斯在车站的工作人员休息室里喝茶。他们自带了杯子，还带来一些饼干。帕克斯还是像平时一样，在啤酒罐里泡茶。大家都很开心，说了很多话。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children were drinking tea with Mr. Perks in the porter's room at the station. They had brought their own cups and some biscuits. Perks made tea in a beer can as usual, and everyone was happy and talkative.

            “帕克斯先生，您的生日是几月几号？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>

            "When is your birthday, Mr. Perks?" Bobbie asked him. <br>
            "My birthday?" asked Perks. "I already gave up birthdays!" <br>

            “没那么久，小姐！”&nbsp;帕克斯笑着回答，“其实，这个月15号我就32岁了。”&nbsp;<br>

            "Not that long ago, missy!" Perks grinned as he answered. "Actually, I'll be 32 on the fifteenth of this month." <br>
            Later the children talked. Perks was the best friend they had made. So they decided to do something special for his birthday.

            第二天吃早餐时，妈妈笑着给孩子们粥和牛奶。“我又卖了一个故事。”&nbsp;她说，“所以今天喝茶的时候会有面包。”&nbsp;菲利斯、鲍比和彼得互相看了看。他们在想同一件事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day at breakfast Mother smiled as she gave the children porridge and milk. "I've sold another story," she said, "so there'll be buns for tea." Phyllis, Bobbie, and Peter looked at each other. They were thinking the same thing.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “妈妈，我们可以改在15号吃面包吗？”&nbsp;鲍比问，“那天是帕克斯的生日，我们想开一个小派对。”&nbsp;<br>
            “当然可以。”&nbsp;妈妈回答，“我们可以用糖粉把他的名字写在面包上！”&nbsp;孩子们很兴奋。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Mother, can we have buns on the fifteenth instead?" Bobbie asked. "It's Perks' birthday, and we thought we'd have a small party." <br>
            "Yes, you can," Mother replied."We'll put his name on the buns with icing!" The children were excited.

            过了一会儿，鲍比说：“我觉得我们还需要一些花。”&nbsp;<br>
            “对，我们需要有更多的想法！我们安静地想一想吧。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            “有了！”&nbsp;彼得突然大喊，“我想到了！”&nbsp;他跳起来。<br>
            “是什么？”&nbsp;女孩们着急地问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later Bobbie said, "I think we need flowers as well." <br>
            "Yes, we need more ideas! Let's all be quiet and think," said Phyllis. <br>
            "Got it!" Peter cried suddenly. "I've got it!" He jumped up. <br>
            "What?" said his sisters eagerly.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “帕克斯对每个人都很友好，一定有很多人想送他礼物。我们去问问大家吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            “妈妈说我们不应该向别人要东西。”&nbsp;鲍比有点犹豫。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of people who'd like to give presents to Perks. Let's go round and ask everyone." <br>
            "Mother said we shouldn't ask people for things," said Bobbie doubtfully.

            “为了我们自己不可以，但是可以为了别人要。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            于是他们出发了。邮局的老奶奶不想给帕克斯礼物。“明天是我的生日，但是没有人在乎。”&nbsp;她说，“我为什么要在乎帕克斯的生日呢？”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "For ourselves, silly, not for other people," said Peter. <br>
            So they went. The old lady at the post office didn't want to give Perks a present. "It's my birthday tomorrow and nobody cares about it," she said. "Why should I give him a present?"

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The children left the post office and went elsewhere. Some people were kind and some were not. At the end of the day, Peter wrote a list of things they'd received. He wrote it in the book where he kept the numbers of train engines.

            Early the next morning, Bobbie woke Phyllis. They had a plan but had not told Peter. They didn't tell him because he would think it was silly. They cut a bunch of roses and wrote a card: "For Mrs. Ransome, Happy Birthday!" <br>

            邮局的老奶奶对鲍比、菲利斯和彼得说：“你们都是好孩子。这是一辆闲置的婴儿车，本来是给我的孙子买的，但我们在他六个月的时候失去了他。所以我想把这个送给帕克斯夫人的小宝宝。”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            菲利斯抱住老奶奶说：“帕克斯会非常开心的。”&nbsp;<br>

            The old lady at the post office said to Bobbie, Phyllis, and Peter, "You're good children. Here's a pram I'm not using. I bought it for my daughter's baby, but he died at six months old. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have the pram for her baby," she said. <br>

            They packed all the gifts into the pram and came to Perks' house. <br>

            "We've got some presents for Mr. Perks' birthday," said Peter.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the children first moved into the white house, they talked about Father a lot. They were always asking questions about him. But as time passed, the questions seemed to make Mother unhappy. So they stopped asking them.

            一天，妈妈在忙碌地工作。鲍比把茶端到妈妈的“办公室”&nbsp;。房间里没有什么家具，只有一张桌子、一把椅子和一块地毯。但孩子们总会在窗台上放一瓶花。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One day, when Mother was working very hard, Bobbie carried some tea up to Mother's "workshop." The room had hardly any furniture, just a table, a chair, and a rug. But the children always put flowers on the windowsills.

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mother had agreed to give the children each a piece of garden. The children could plant whatever they liked. Phyllis had planted flowers in hers, and they looked like weeds. But Phyllis believed they would be flowers one day.

            彼得在他的花园里撒了蔬菜种子。有胡萝卜、洋葱和大头菜。但是蔬菜从没长出来过。因为彼得用泥土为玩具士兵做了堡垒和运河。<br>
            鲍比在她的花园里种了很多玫瑰花，但新长出来的叶子都是棕色的。她希望这些玫瑰不会死。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his garden. There were carrots, onions, and turnips. But the vegetables never grew. That was because Peter used the dirt to make forts and canals for his toy soldiers. <br>
            Bobbie had planted rosebushes in her garden, but all the new leaves were brown. She hoped they weren't dead.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            一天，帕克斯来看花园。他劝鲍比烧掉她的玫瑰花。<br>
            “鲍比，把它们挖出来烧掉！”&nbsp;帕克斯说，“我的花园里有玫瑰，我送给你一些。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            One day Perks came to see the garden. He told her that the rosebushes should go in a bonfire. <br>
            "Dig them up and burn them, Miss Bobbie!" Perks said. "I have some roses in my garden, and I will give you some."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            于是，鲍比开始挖玫瑰，然后把它们扔到花园的另一边。鲍比扔完回来，看到彼得在用她的耙子。<br>
            “耙子我正在用呢！”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “我也正在用呢！”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            “但是是我先拿的！”&nbsp;鲍比说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So she started digging up her rosebushes and throw them to the other side of the garden. Bobbie came back and saw Peter using the rake. <br>
            "I was using the rake!" she said. <br>
            "I'm using it now!" said Peter. <br>
            "But I had it first!" said Bobbie.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在轮到我了！”&nbsp;彼得说。于是他们俩开始吵架。<br>
            “你总会为一些小事生气。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            “是我先拿到耙子的。”&nbsp;鲍比抓着耙子不放，“今天早上我明明说过我要用的。我说了吧，菲利斯？”&nbsp;菲利斯没有回答。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Then it's my turn now!" said Peter, and the fight began. <br>
            "You're always annoyed about small things," Peter said.<br>
            "I had the rake first," Bobbie said, holding its handle. "Didn't I tell you this morning that I would be using it? Didn't I say that, Phyllis?" Phyllis didn't answer.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “菲利斯，回答呀！”&nbsp;彼得说。但菲利斯还是没有回答。“我希望我有一个兄弟，而不是两个姐妹。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            鲍比很生气。但她想起自己要努力做个好孩子，于是就放开了手。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Phyllis, answer!" Peter said, but Phyllis didn't. "I wish I'd had a brother instead of two sisters," Peter said. <br>
            Bobbie was angry. Then she remembered she should try to be good. She let go of the rake's handle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            因为彼得一直在用力，所以鲍比一放开，他就摔倒了。彼得在地上静静躺了一分钟，这让鲍比慌了。他坐起来，然后他突然尖叫了一声，又躺下不停地哭。<br>
            妈妈跑出来，蹲在彼得身边问：“怎么了？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter had been pulling at the rake, so when Bobbie let go, he fell down. Peter lay still for a minute, long enough to frighten Bobbie. Then he sat up and screamed, and then lay down and cried steadily. <br>
            Mother ran outside and knelt beside Peter. "What happened?"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “鲍比和彼得都在拉耙子。”&nbsp;菲利斯回答，“鲍比一放手，彼得就摔倒了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “彼得，别哭了。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“你受伤了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我觉得我的脚破了，太疼了。”&nbsp;彼得脸色苍白。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bobbie and Peter were both pulling the rake," replied Phyllis. "Bobbie let go and Peter fell over." <br>
            "Peter, stop crying," said Mother. "Are you hurt?" <br>
            "I think my foot's broken, it hurts so much," said Peter. Then Peter went quite white.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他受伤了。他昏过去了。”&nbsp;妈妈说。她解开彼得的靴子。在脱右脚的时候，有东西从他的脚上滴下来——是血。<br>
            耙子的底部刺进了彼得的脚，脚在流血。妈妈把他抱回家，菲利斯跑去找医生。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He is hurt. He's fainted," Mother said. She undid Peter's boots. As she took his right boot off, something dripped from his foot to the ground. It was red blood. <br>
            The bottom of the rake had gone into Peter's foot, and it was bleeding. Mother carried him into the house, and Phyllis ran for the doctor.

            鲍比去车站帮彼得拿杂志。那些是旧杂志，是留在火车上或者候车室里别人不要的。帕克斯说他们可以拿回家。<br>
            “我用报纸和绳子帮你把杂志捆起来吧。”&nbsp;帕克斯说。他从一堆报纸里拿了一张旧报纸，把杂志包了起来。

            "I'll put some newspaper and string around the magazines to keep them together," Perks said. He took an old newspaper from the pile and wrapped up the magazines.

            “他就是大家都要抓的人。”&nbsp;鲍比向彼得和菲利斯讲游戏规则。

            "All the other boys have to chase after him." The boy carried a bag full of little pieces of paper. <br>

            鲍比拉着菲利斯，朝着彼得发出声音的方向走去。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Don't be scared. It's quite safe," said Bobbie. "Stand back." <br>
            "Come up here! There's a space!" Peter shouted. The sound of the train was now a roar. <br>
            Bobbie dragged Phyllis, and walked toward Peter's voice.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            隧道的墙上有一个挖出来的洞，他们躲了进去。火车的声音越来越大。他们觉得耳朵快要聋了。<br>
            他们看到远远的车灯，就像龙的眼睛一样。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            There was a small space dug out of the tunnel wall. They hid in there. The train roared louder and louder. It seemed as if it would deafen them. <br>
            In the distance they could see the lights of the train. They were like a dragon's eyes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            火车好像在对着他们咆哮。菲利斯和鲍比紧紧抱在一起。<br>
            火车经过的时候，灯光非常刺眼。他们感到了一阵阵热气，还闻到了一股烟味儿。彼得也害怕得紧紧抓着鲍比的胳膊。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The train was screaming toward them. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other. <br>
            The train roared by, and the lights were harsh. The children felt a blast of hot air and smelled smoke. Peter was frightened and he grabbed Bobbie's arm tightly.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            虽然他解释说那是因为“觉得她会害怕”&nbsp;才抓的。<br>
            慢慢地，声音变小了，灯光也越变越弱。呜！火车开出了隧道。<br>
            “哇！”&nbsp;孩子们同时说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later he explained that it was "in case she was scared." <br>
            Slowly the noise got softer and the lights got smaller and smaller and smaller. With one last whee! the train left the tunnel. <br>
            "Wow!" said the children together.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            彼得用颤抖的手点亮了蜡烛。“快走吧。”&nbsp;他的声音也在颤抖。<br>
            “哦！”&nbsp;菲利斯说，“如果穿红衣服的男孩儿在火车轨道上怎么办？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们必须快点儿找到他。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter lit the candle with a shaking hand. "Come on," he said, his voice shaking too. <br>
            "Oh!" said Phyllis. "What if the boy with the red shirt was in the way of the train?" <br>
            "We must keep looking for him," said Peter.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们走向隧道深处。彼得走在前面，拿着蜡烛照路。突然，彼得停下大喊：“有人吗？”&nbsp;然后他走得更快了。女孩儿们追上他，看到了那个男孩儿。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel. Peter went first, holding the candle to light the way. Suddenly Peter stood still and shouted, "Hello!" Then he hurried ahead. When the girls reached him, they saw the boy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            彼得停在离他一米远的地方。菲利斯看到了红色的东西，于是她害怕得紧紧闭上眼睛。穿着红衣服的男孩儿躺在铁轨附近。他闭着眼睛，一动不动。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter had stopped about a meter from him. Phyllis saw something red, so she got scared and shut her eyes tight. The boy in the red shirt was on the ground, beside the tracks. His eyes were closed, and he did not move.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他……死了吗？”&nbsp;菲利斯闭着眼睛问。<br>
            “当然没有！”&nbsp;彼得说，“他只是晕倒了。我们该怎么办？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们能搬得动他吗？”&nbsp;鲍比问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Is he . . . dead?" asked Phyllis, closing her eyes. <br>
            "Of course not!" said Peter. "He's fainted, that's all. What should we do?" <br>
            "Can we move him?" asked Bobbie.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不知道，他个头挺大的。”&nbsp;彼得回答，“在他额头洒点儿水怎么样？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们没有水，但是有午餐时剩的牛奶。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“试试吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't know, he's a big fellow," replied Peter. "How about we put some water on his forehead?" <br>
            "We don't have any water, but we have some milk from lunch," Bobbie said. "Let's try that!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好。我记得好像按摩手就可以让昏迷的人醒过来。”&nbsp;菲利斯说。<br>
            于是鲍比在他的额头上洒了些温牛奶，彼得按摩他的手。接着，三个孩子一起说：“快醒醒！&nbsp;快醒醒！”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes, and I think people sometimes rub people's hands to help them wake up," said Phyllis. <br>
            So Bobbie splashed warm milk onto his forehead while Peter rubbed the boy's hands. Then together the three children said, "Please wake up! Please speak!"<br>

            “用牛奶弄湿他的耳朵。”&nbsp;鲍比建议说，“人晕倒时，用香水这么做有用，我觉得牛奶应该也可以。”&nbsp;于是，他们用牛奶弄湿了男孩儿的耳朵。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Open your eyes! Please! Speak to us!" The children said these words over and over again. <br>

            “他没死！”&nbsp;鲍比坚持说。彼得摇了摇男孩儿的胳膊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was very dark in the tunnel. Peter's candle was really short, and not very bright. <br>
            "Please open your eyes!" said Phyllis. "I believe he's dead." <br>
            "He isn't!" insisted Bobbie. Peter shook the boy's arm.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Slowly the boy opened his eyes and sighed quietly. <br>
            "Oh, he's not dead!" cried Phyllis. "I knew he wasn't!" She began to cry. <br>
            "Don't cry. I'm all right," said the boy. <br>
            "Phyllis, please be quiet," Peter said. "Drink this."

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What is it?" the boy asked.<br>
            "It's milk," said Peter. "Don't worry, we will help you." So the boy drank the milk. The children watched him quietly. "He'll be fine after the milk," Peter whispered to his sisters.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我好多了。”&nbsp;男孩儿说。他想动，但是发出了一声呻吟。“我……我觉得我的腿断了。”&nbsp;他慢慢地说。<br>

            “我被一根电线绊倒了。”&nbsp;男孩儿解释说，“我站不起来，所以坐下了。但是真的很疼。你们是怎么过来的？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'm better now," the boy said. He tried to move but started to groan. "I . . . I think I've broken my leg," he said slowly. <br>
            "Did you fall over?" asked Phyllis. <br>
            "I tripped on a wire," the boy explained. "I couldn't stand, so I sat down. It does hurt, though. How did you all get here?"

            "You're all very brave!" said the boy. <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I can try," said the boy. He tried, but he could only stand on one foot. "Oh, I must sit down, it hurts too much." He sat down again and went to sleep. The children looked at each other. <br>

            鲍比看着他们离开，然后把短短的蜡烛放在地上。“现在的你，不是傻丫头！”&nbsp;她自言自语地说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Peter looked worried. "Let me stay, and you and Phyllis go." <br>

            Bobbie watched them disappear and put the little candle on the ground. "Now don't be a silly girl!" she said to herself.

            如果有人叫鲍比“傻丫头”&nbsp;，她总是非常生气。但她生自己的气时，也会这样叫自己。<br>
            她拔出小刀，割开男孩儿的靴子。<br>
            鲍比想脱下他的袜子，但是他的腿太肿了。隧道里好像更黑了。一切看上去都很不真实。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Bobbie was always very angry if anybody called her a "silly girl." But when she was angry with herself, she could say it. <br>
            Then she opened Peter's knife and used it to cut the boy's boot. <br>
            Bobbie tried to pull off his sock, but his leg was too swollen. It seemed the tunnel was getting darker. Nothing seemed quite real.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “傻丫头。”&nbsp;鲍比又说。她看着男孩儿的腿。“应该在下面垫一个软的东西。”&nbsp;她想。她想起了自己的衬裙。她小心地把衬裙脱下来，垫在男孩儿的腿下面。接下来就只能等了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Silly girl," Bobbie said again. She looked at his broken leg. "It needs something soft under it," she thought. Then she remembered her petticoat. She took it off and carefully put it under the boy's leg. There was nothing else to do but wait.

            They followed Mother into the front room, and there was . . . the old gentleman!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊，是您！”&nbsp;鲍比说。孩子们看到老爷爷都很兴奋。<br>
            “您不会要带吉姆走吧？我希望他能多待一段时间。”&nbsp;彼得说。<br>
            老先生笑了。“我不带他走。”&nbsp;他说，“你们的妈妈很善良。吉姆会留下来，她会好好儿照顾他的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, it's you!" cried Bobbie. The children were excited to see him. <br>
            "But you're not going to take Jim away, are you? I was hoping he could stay for a while," Peter said. <br>
            The old gentleman smiled. "No," he said. "Your mother is very kind. Jim will stay here and she'll look after him."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那妈妈怎么写故事呢？”&nbsp;彼得问。没人来得及阻止他。<br>
            老先生对妈妈笑了笑。<br>
            “她可以不用写故事了，你们会有足够的食物。”&nbsp;老先生说，“鲍比，你可以送我到门口吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What about Mother's writing?" Peter said, before anyone could stop him. The old gentleman smiled kindly at Mother. <br>
            "She can stop writing, and there will be enough food," he said. "Bobbie," said the old man, "can you show me to the door?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            老先生和鲍比走到门外。“鲍比，我收到了你的信，其实在收到你的信之前，我已经看过报纸了。我也试过帮助他。我能做的虽然不多，但还是有希望。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The old gentleman and Bobbie walked outside. "I received your letter, Bobbie. Actually before I received your letter, I had already read the newspaper. I tried to help him. I haven't done much, but I have hope."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “天呐！”&nbsp;鲍比激动地要哭了。<br>
            “但是你要继续保密。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “您也觉得不是爸爸做的，对吗？”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            “我很确定不是他做的。”&nbsp;老先生说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh!" said Bobbie, crying a little. <br>
            "But keep your secret a little longer," he said. <br>
            "You don't think Father did it, do you?" said Bobbie. <br>
            "I'm sure he didn't," said the old gentleman.

            有吉姆在，大家更开心了。他把学校里的事讲给孩子们听。现在，妈妈不用每天写故事了，于是她给孩子们上课。<br>
            “不知道铁路有没有想我们。”&nbsp;菲利斯说，“我们很久都没有向9点15分的火车挥手了。我们明天去吧！”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Life at home was better with Jim around. He told the children stories about his school. Now that Mother was not writing stories every day, she gave the children some lessons. <br>
            "I wonder if the railway misses us," said Phyllis. "We haven't waved to the 9:15 in a long time. Let's do it tomorrow!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            第二天，他们来到栏杆边。他们看着9点15分的火车从隧道开出来。<br>
            “把我们的爱带给爸爸！”&nbsp;他们挥着手帕喊。老先生也在窗口向他们挥手。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So the next morning they ran down to the fence. They watched the 9:15 train coming out of the tunnel. <br>
            "Take our love to Father!" they shouted as they waved their handkerchiefs. The old gentleman waved from his window.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这并不奇怪，因为他总是这样。但是今天有一点儿不同。<br>
            每个窗户都有人拿着手帕和报纸向他们挥手，并对他们微笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And there was nothing strange about that, because he had always waved. But something was different. <br>
            People waved handkerchiefs and newspapers from every window of the train. Their smiling faces looked at the children.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哇！”&nbsp;孩子们说，“为什么大家都向我们挥手？”&nbsp;<br>
            “可能是老先生让大家挥手的。”&nbsp;鲍比说。<br>
            确实是这样！老先生早早就到火车站，拜托了每一位乘客。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wow!" said the children. "Why did everybody wave?" <br>
            "Perhaps the old gentleman asked the people to wave," said Bobbie. <br>
            And that was just what had happened! The old gentleman had gotten to his station early, and he had talked to every passenger.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乘客们有的很惊讶，有的很好奇，还有的怀疑或者生气。但是后来，乘客们都看到了报纸上的一篇文章，这让他们都很开心。于是，当他们看到孩子们时，就一起向他们挥手了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Some passengers were surprised. Some were curious while others were doubtful or grumpy. But then the passengers sat inside the train and read a particular story in the newspaper. That made them all very pleased. Later, when they saw the children, they all waved.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            回到家里，鲍比一直在想这件事，不能认真上课。妈妈同意她提前离开。<br>
            “我要去火车站和帕克斯聊聊。”&nbsp;鲍比想。<br>
            火车站里，好像每个人都拿着一份报纸。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Back at home later, Bobbie could not concentrate at all. Mother allowed her to leave early.<br>
            "I'll go and talk to Perks at the station," thought Bobbie.<br>
            At the station it seemed as if everyone was holding a newspaper.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            几个通常从不对她微笑的人，竟然在对她微笑！<br>
            “真奇怪。”&nbsp;她想。帕克斯不知道在哪里。于是，鲍比对火车站里的猫说：“今天大家都很友好。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Several people who usually never smiled at her smiled at her!<br>
            "How strange," she thought. Perks wasn't anywhere so Bobbie chatted with the station cat. "How friendly everyone is today."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            11点54分的火车快要进站时，帕克斯出现了。他也拿着一份报纸。<br>
            “你好！”&nbsp;他对鲍比说，“我看到报纸了，真为你高兴！”&nbsp;<br>
            “您在报纸上看到什么了？”&nbsp;鲍比问。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Perks appeared when it was time for the 11:54 to arrive. He had a newspaper too. <br>
            "Hello!" he said to Bobbie. "I saw it in the newspaper, and I'm so happy for you!" <br>
            "What did you see in the newspaper?" asked Bobbie.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但是11点54分的火车已经进站了。帕克斯看向每一个窗户。有三个人下了火车：第一个是拿着三个盒子的女人，第二个是提着棕色行李箱的女人，第三个是……
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But already the 11:54 was steaming into the station. Perks looked in all the train windows. Only three people got off the train. The first was a woman with three boxes. The second was a woman with a brown suitcase. And the third . . .
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦！爸爸！我的爸爸！”&nbsp;鲍比大喊。大家都把头伸出窗外，静静地看着这个高大但脸色苍白的男人，还有紧紧抱着她的女孩儿。鲍比觉得自己永远都不会放开爸爸。<br>
            “今天早上妈妈没有收到我的信吗？”&nbsp;爸爸问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh! My daddy, my daddy!" cried Bobbie. People put their heads out of the windows. Everyone looked at the tall, pale man and the little girl who was hugging him. Bobbie thought she could never let go. <br>
            "Didn't Mother get my letter this morning?" asked Father.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “今天早上没有信。”&nbsp;鲍比说，“哦，爸爸，真的是你吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            爸爸握住她的手说：“现在没事了。他们抓住了真正的间谍。”&nbsp;<br>
            “大家都知道你不是间谍。”&nbsp;鲍比自豪地说，“我们——我、妈妈和老先生一直都很确信。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "There wasn't any mail this morning," Bobbie said. "Oh, Daddy, is it really you?" <br>
            Father held her hand and said, "It's all right. They caught the real spy."<br>
            "Everybody knows that you aren't a spy," said Bobbie proudly. "We—me, Mother, and the old gentleman—always knew that."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对。我得谢谢你的朋友。”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            爸爸和鲍比一起走向他们的房子。鲍比先跑进去，想着该怎么告诉妈妈这个好消息。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes, I must thank your friend," said Father. <br>
            Father and Bobbie walked together to the house. Bobbie rushed inside first, trying to think of a way to tell Mother the news.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爸爸在花园里等着，看着花园里漂亮的花。被关了这么久，每一朵花对他来说都是一个小奇迹。<br>
            过了一会儿，鲍比打开门。“快进来，爸爸。”&nbsp;她大喊，“欢迎回家！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Father waited in the garden, looking at all the flowers. He had been locked away for so long, each one seemed like a tiny miracle now.<br>
            A second later Bobbie threw open the door. "Come in, Daddy," she shouted. "Come home!"
