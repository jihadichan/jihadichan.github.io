            星期六，凯蒂·多诺万坐在厨房的地板上，摸着家里的狗麦古。<br>
            她的双胞胎姐姐乔伊坐在大圆桌旁等着吃零食。<br>
            家里最好的厨师——爷爷，刚烤了布朗尼。<br>
            “嗯......”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“我爱布朗尼！”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was Saturday, and Katie Donovan sat on the kitchen floor petting Magoo, the family dog. Her twin sister, Joy, was at the big round table, waiting for a snack. Grandpa, the best cook in the family, had just baked brownies.<br>
            “Mmm,” said Katie. “I love brownies!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，妈妈望着窗外说：“邮车来了，姑娘们。它正在转弯。”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂跳了起来。“我们走吧，麦古！”&nbsp;<br>
            她和猎狗飞快地穿过房子，从前门跑了出去。<br>
            麦古一直跟着凯蒂跑到了车道上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then Mom looked out the window and spoke.“The mail truck is coming, girls. It’s turning the corner.” <br>
            Katie jumped up. “Let’s go, Magoo!” She and the hound raced through the house and out the front door. Magoo followed Katie all the way down the driveway.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            除了生日卡，凯蒂几乎没有收到过任何信件。<br>
            而且，那些生日卡也是寄给凯蒂和乔伊·多诺万的。<br>
            但两个女孩还是喜欢来信件时去拿信。<br>
            邮车轰轰地停在黑莓路10号。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie hardly ever got any mail, except birthday cards. And those were sent to Katie and Joy Donovan. But both girls still liked to collect the mail when it came.<br>
            The mail truck rumbled to a stop at 10 Blackberry Road.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            邮递员把头探出窗外。<br>
            “你好，麦古！”&nbsp;他喊道，把信给了凯蒂。<br>
            “你好，杰夫叔叔。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            杰夫仔细地看着她。“你是双胞胎里的哪个？”&nbsp;他问道。<br>
            凯蒂叹了口气。“我是凯蒂。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The mailman leaned out of the window. “Hello, Magoo!” he called and gave the mail to Katie. <br>
            “Hello, Jeff,” said Katie. <br>
            Jeff looked at her closely. “Which twin are you?” he asked. <br>
            Katie sighed. “I’m KATIE.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我总是分不清你们俩。”&nbsp;杰夫说。<br>
            然后，他沿着路开车走了。<br>
            “我们完全不一样......”&nbsp;当邮车消失在一片尘土中时，凯蒂嘟哝说。<br>
            凯蒂喜欢有一个和她一模一样的双胞胎姐姐。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I always get you two mixed-up,” said Jeff. Then he drove off down the road.<br>
            “We’re totally different . . . ,” mumbled Katie as the mail truck disappeared in a cloud of dust. Katie liked having a sister who was her identical twin.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            但她讨厌人们分不清她们。这种事一直都在发生。<br>
            “你知道我是谁，对吧，麦古？”&nbsp;凯蒂小声说。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            麦古闻了闻她的手。“对&nbsp;。乔伊和我闻起来不一样，不是吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But she hated it when people couldn't tell them apart. It happened all the time.<br>
            “You know who I am, don’t you, Magoo?” whispered Katie. Magoo sniffed her hand. “That’s right. Joy and I smell different, don’t we?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            房子里充满了布朗尼的味道。<br>
            “信来了！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。她读了第一个信封上的名字。<br>
            “约翰·多诺万收，阳光种子公司寄。”&nbsp;<br>
            “太好了！”&nbsp;爷爷说，“我的玉米种子！”&nbsp;爷爷要把它种在园子了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The house smelled like brownies. <br>
            “Mail delivery!” Katie called out. She read the name on the first envelope. “For John Donovan—from Sunshine Seed Company.”<br>
            “Great!” said Grandpa. “My corn seeds!” Grandpa would be planting the garden soon.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是给戴布拉·多诺万的信。”&nbsp;凯蒂边说边翻着信件。<br>
            妈妈正在看一本关于密苏里鸟的书。“谢谢，宝贝。”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Here’s a letter for Debra Donovan,” said Katie, flipping through the mail. <br>
            Mom was looking at a book about Missouri birds. “Thanks, honey,” she said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “还有给史蒂夫·多诺万的新《绿色杂志》！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。<br>
            这是一本关于回收利用的杂志。爸爸有一间柳树溪回收中心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “And for Steve Donovan—the new Green Zine!”exclaimed Katie.<br>
            This was a magazine all about recycling. Dad owned the Willow Creek Recycling Center.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “剩下的是垃圾信件。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“今天没有我们的信件，乔伊。除非你想要一份小鸡目录！它来自一个叫‘咯咯农场’的地方。”&nbsp;她笑着说。“好。”&nbsp;乔伊说。&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂从桌上拿起一块布朗尼。“好？”&nbsp;凯蒂惊讶地重复道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “The rest is junk mail,” said Katie. “Nothing for us today, Joy. Unless you want a chicken catalog! It’s from a place called the Cackle Farm.” She said with a grin.<br>
            “Okay,” said Joy.<br>
            Katie grabbed a brownie from the table. “Okay?” echoed Katie in surprise.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好，我要看看目录。”&nbsp;乔伊重复道。<br>
            “真的吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂把目录递给她。“你对小鸡感兴趣？”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;乔伊翻了翻目录。“嘿，我不知道鸡有这么多颜色。”&nbsp;她说，<br>
            “看看这个，凯蒂！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Okay, I’ll look at the catalog,” repeated Joy. <br>
            “Really?” Katie handed it to her. “You’re interested in chickens?”<br>
            “Yep.” Joy flipped through the catalog. “Hey, I didn’t know chickens came in all these colors,” she said. “Look at this one, Katie!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不喜欢小鸡。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“你喜欢它们。”&nbsp;<br>
            “有时候你好没意思。”&nbsp;乔伊抱怨道。&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂没理乔伊，而是跟着爸爸。爸爸正拿着一个桶去堆肥箱。“爸爸。”&nbsp;她慢慢地问道，“你是怎么区分我和乔伊的呢？”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I don’t like chickens,” Katie said. “You like them.” <br>
            “You’re no fun sometimes,” Joy complained.<br>
            Katie ignored Joy's words and followed Dad. He was going outside carrying the compost bucket. “Dad,” she asked slowly, “how can you tell Joy and me apart?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，那很简单。我只是......嗯......”&nbsp;然后，爸爸笑了。<br>
            “我知道。你的雀斑！你鼻子上有十四个雀斑。乔伊有十二个！”&nbsp;“哦，爸爸！”&nbsp;凯蒂抱怨道。&nbsp;<br>
            “你不相信我？你去数一数！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Oh, that’s easy. I just . . . Well . . .” Then Dad grinned. “I know. Your freckles! You have fourteen freckles on your nose. Joy has twelve!” <br>
            “Oh, Dad!” Katie moaned.<br>
            “You don’t believe me? Go count them!”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂翻了个白眼，走回屋子里面。她爸爸在取笑她。他不明白，有时候做双胞胎很难。<br>
            乔伊还在看目录。“当这些鸡是小鸡的时候，我们可以买来养它们。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie rolled her eyes and walked back inside. Her father was teasing her. He didn’t understand that sometimes it was hard to be a twin.<br>
            Joy was still looking at the catalog. “We can buy these chickens when they are tiny chicks and raise them.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “然后，我们要做什么呢？做炸鸡？哈！”&nbsp;凯蒂开玩笑说。<br>
            “我们不吃它们！”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我们吃它们的蛋！”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “塔克杂货店的鸡蛋有什么问题吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Then what would we do? Make fried chicken? HA!” joked Katie.<br>
            “We wouldn’t eat them!” Joy said. “We’d eat their eggs!” <br>
            “What’s wrong with the eggs from Tucker’s Grocery?” asked Katie.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊皱起了眉头。“小鸡很有趣，凯蒂。不像你！”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂看向别处。她知道她对乔伊有点刻薄，但出于某种原因，她今天没办法控制自己。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy made a face. “Chickens are fun, Katie—not like you right now!”<br>
            Katie looked away. She knew she was being a little mean to her sister. But for some reason, she couldn’t help it today.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            星期天早上，爷爷正在给每个人做薄饼。乔伊仍然穿着她的睡衣，在说养鸡的事情。<br>
            “这只鸡有一个蓝色的尾巴。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“还有，这只脚上有羽毛！”&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was Sunday morning, and Grandpa was making everyone pancakes. Joy was still in her pajamas and still talking about chickens. <br>
            “This one has a blue tail,” said Joy. “And this one has feathers on its feet!”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈笑了。“它们看起来像室内拖鞋。”&nbsp;<br>
            爷爷拿给乔伊一盘薄饼，在她身后看了看目录。“看到那只有黑白条纹的了吗？”&nbsp;他说，“我小时候有一只这样的母鸡。有时它睡在我腿上，就像一只猫。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mom smiled. “They look like house slippers.” <br>
            Grandpa gave Joy a plate of pancakes and looked over her shoulder at the catalog. “See that one with the black and white stripes?” he said. “We had a hen like that when I was a boy. Sometimes she slept in my lap—just like a cat.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爸爸笑了。“那么乔伊！”&nbsp;他说，“我们养些鸡怎么样？”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊的眼睛睁得大大的，她的脸上露出了大大的笑容。<br>
            “哦，爸爸！我们可以吗？我们能买些小鸡吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Dad smiled. “So Joy,” he said, “do you think we should get some chickens?”<br>
            Joy’s eyes opened wide, and a big smile spread across her face. “Oh, Dad! Could we? Could we buy some little chicks?”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它们不会一直很小的。”&nbsp;妈妈提醒说，<br>
            “它们会变成大鸡。你会照顾它们吗？你会喂它们吃的和水吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的，我保证。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我也会捡鸡蛋的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “They won’t be little for long,” warned Mom. “They’ll become big chickens. Would you take care of them? Would you feed them and give them water?”<br>
            “Yes, I promise,” said Joy. “And I’d gather the eggs too.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我可以用那些新鲜鸡蛋做一些美味蛋卷。”&nbsp;爷爷说。<br>
            “凯蒂在哪儿？”&nbsp;乔伊问道，在桌子旁跳了起来。她跑到楼梯那里，喊道：“下来，凯蒂！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “I could make some delicious omelets with those fresh eggs,” said Grandpa.<br>
            “Where’s Katie?” asked Joy, jumping up from the table. She ran to the stairway and called, “Come down, Katie!”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            楼上，凯蒂没有听见她姐姐的声音。她正忙着站在浴室的镜子前看自己。&nbsp;<br>
            猫咪“杰利”&nbsp;坐在门口，舔着它的灰色的毛。<br>
            “我动手啦。”&nbsp;凯蒂拿起剪刀低声说。杰利停止舔毛，用圆圆的黄眼睛看着凯蒂。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Upstairs Katie didn’t hear her sister. She was busy staring at herself in the bathroom mirror. Jelly, the cat, was sitting in the doorway, licking her gray fur.<br>
            “Here we go,” Katie whispered as she picked up the scissors. Jelly stopped licking and watched Katie with round, yellow eyes.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            楼下，爸爸在说话。“当我们自给自足时，这对地球有好处。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “我希望我还记得如何照顾小鸡。”&nbsp;爷爷说。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Downstairs Dad was talking. “It’s good for the planet when we raise our own food,” he said.<br>
            “I hope I can remember how to take care of baby chickens,” said Grandpa.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你得教我，爷爷。”&nbsp;乔伊坐回桌边回答道。她已经放弃了努力吸引凯蒂的注意力。<br>
            “明天我会把一本关于养鸡方面的书带回家。”&nbsp;妈妈说。她在柳树溪图书馆兼职。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You have to teach me, Grandpa,” replied Joy as she sat back down at the table. She’d given up trying to get Katie’s attention.<br>
            “I’ll bring home a book on the subject tomorrow,” said Mom. She worked part-time at the Willow Creek library.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，大家都抬头看天花板。他们听到凯蒂在上面走廊里的脚步声。<br>
            然后，他们听到她哐哐地跑下楼梯。<br>
            “她来了。”&nbsp;乔伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly everyone looked up at the ceiling. They heard Katie’s footsteps in the hallway above. Then they heard her pounding down the stairs. <br>
            “Here she comes,” said Joy.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “大家，早上好！”&nbsp;凯蒂蹦跳进厨房大喊道。她光着脚转了一圈。“注意到我有什么不同吗？”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            麦古一直在角落里打盹。它睁开了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Good morning, world!” Katie exclaimed as she popped into the kitchen. She twirled on her bare feet. “Notice anything different about me?”<br>
            Magoo, who had been napping in the corner, opened his eyes.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的，我注意到你拿着剪刀跑下来！”&nbsp;妈妈大声责怪道，“那真的很危险。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂低头看着手中的剪刀。“哎呀。”&nbsp;她说，“对不起。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Yes, I noticed that you ran down the steps with scissors!” scolded Mom. “That’s really dangerous.”<br>
            Katie looked down at the scissors in her hand. “Oops,” she said. “Sorry.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你的头发好像有变化。”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            “你剪了个刘海！”&nbsp;乔伊脱口而出。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “答对了！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。<br>
            乔伊皱起眉头。“可是，凯蒂。”&nbsp;她说，“现在我们看起来不一样了。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “Your hair seems to have changed a little,” stated Dad.<br>
            “You’ve got bangs!” Joy burst out.<br>
            “Ta-da!” exclaimed Katie. <br>
            Joy frowned. “But Katie,” she said, “now we look different.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “没错。”&nbsp;凯蒂高兴地说，“从现在开始，我就是那个有刘海的了。”&nbsp;<br>
            她在桌旁坐了下来。“爷爷，能给我些薄饼吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你剪得不错，凯蒂。”&nbsp;妈妈评价道。

            “That’s right,” Katie said happily. “From now on, I’m the one with bangs.” She sat down at the table.“Grandpa, may I have some pancakes, please?”<br>
            “You did a good job, Katie,” Mom commented.<br>

            乔伊看了一圈桌子，很不开心。“可是......我们看起来还像双胞胎吗？”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “当然了。”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            “不。”&nbsp;凯蒂纠正道，“我们看起来完全不一样。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy looked around the table, upset. “But . . . do we still look like twins?” <br>
            “Sure you do,” said Dad. <br>
            “Nope,” corrected Katie. “We look completely different.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            这时，妈妈开口了。“乔伊，告诉凯蒂小鸡的事情吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            “小鸡？”&nbsp;凯蒂重复道。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我们要从‘咯咯农场’弄来小鸡！”&nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;凯蒂盯着乔伊。“我们要做什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            “可多了。”&nbsp;乔伊又笑了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then Mom spoke up. “Joy, tell Katie about the chickens.”<br>
            “Chickens?” repeated Katie.<br>
            “Yes,” said Joy. “We’re getting chicks from the Cackle Farm!” <br>
            Katie stared at her sister. “What will we have to do?”<br>
            “Lots!” Joy was smiling again.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你看，它们必须在室内住一段时间。我们必须给它们保暖，每分钟都要看着它们。”&nbsp;<br>
            当凯蒂想到可爱的小鸡时，她差点笑了。<br>
            但是，她马上记起自己是多诺万双胞胎中不喜欢小鸡的那个。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “You see, they have to live indoors for a while. We have to keep them warm and watch them every minute.” <br>
            When Katie thought of the cute little chicks, she almost smiled. But then she remembered that she was the Donovan twin who didn’t like chickens.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊注意到凯蒂茫然的表情。“你不激动吗？”&nbsp;她问道。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂耸了耸肩，把糖浆倒在薄饼上。<br>
            “最后一次吃薄饼的机会，姑娘们。”&nbsp;爷爷说，“乔伊和我得把厨房打扫干净。因为我们有一个养鸡计划！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy noticed Katie’s blank expression. “Aren’t you excited?” she asked. <br>
            Katie shrugged and poured syrup on her pancakes.<br>
            “Last chance for pancakes, folks,” Grandpa announced. “Joy and I have to get this kitchen cleaned up. We’ve got chicken plans!”

            第二天，凯蒂和乔伊骑着自行车去布恩小学。&nbsp;他们都很兴奋。<br>
            凯蒂等不及每个人都看到她的新刘海。&nbsp;乔伊想把小鸡的事告诉大家。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day Katie and Joy rode their bicycles to Boone Elementary School. They were both excited. Katie couldn’t wait for everyone to see her new bangs. And Joy wanted to tell everyone about the chickens.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “卢克在那儿！”&nbsp;乔伊喊道。她朝一个穿着T恤的男孩挥了挥手。T恤上写着“我挖蚯蚓”&nbsp;。卢克是凯蒂和乔伊的表弟。<br>
            “乔伊。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“你为什么不等到希金斯老师上科学课呢？<br>
            然后，告诉大家关于小鸡的事。学习动物也是科学的一部分。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There’s Luke!” shouted Joy. She waved at a boy in a T-shirt that said “I DIG WORMS.” Luke was Katie and Joy’s cousin. <br>
            “Joy,” said Katie, “why don’t you wait until Mr. Higgins starts the science lesson? Then tell everybody about the chicks. Learning about animals is part of science.”
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊犹豫了一下。“好吧，如果你这么认为的话。”&nbsp;她说，“我想我可以等到上科学课。”&nbsp;<br>
            但凯蒂迫不及待地想分享她的新闻。“嘿，卢克！我剪了个刘海！现在，没人会把我和乔伊搞混了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “哦。这很好。”&nbsp;卢克回答说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joy hesitated. “Well, if you think so,” she said. “I guess I could wait until science.” <br>
            But Katie didn’t wait to share her news. “Hey, Luke! I’ve got bangs! Now nobody will mix me up with Joy!” <br>
            “Oh. That’s good,” Luke replied.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你的诱饵生意怎么样？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。卢克抓蚯蚓卖给加油站的渔民。<br>
            “非常好。”&nbsp;卢克说，“周六，我卖了八杯蚯蚓，每杯一美元。<br>
            等到夏天，我想我的蚯蚓不够卖了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How’s your bait business?” asked Katie. Luke collected earthworms and sold them to fishermen at the gas station. <br>
            “Excellent,” said Luke. “On Saturday I sold eight cups of worms for a dollar each. Wait until summer. I probably won’t have enough worms to sell.”

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “劳拉来了！”&nbsp;乔伊喊道。劳拉•莱曼也在三年级。<br>
            “有什么新闻？”&nbsp;劳拉问。<br>
            “我剪了个刘海。”&nbsp;凯蒂脱口而出。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “我有件令人兴奋的事儿要告诉大家。”&nbsp;乔伊低声对劳拉说，“但我还不能说。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here comes Laura!” exclaimed Joy. Laura Layman was in the third grade too. <br>
            “What’s new?” Laura asked. <br>
            “I’ve got bangs,” Katie blurted out. <br>
            “And I’ve got something exciting to tell everyone,” Joy whispered to Laura. “But I can’t say it yet.”<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Principal Olson, the school principal, stood outside the front door. “Good morning, twins,” she said. “Good morning, Luke, Laura.” <br>
            “Good morning, Principal Olson,” said Katie. “From now on please remember that Katie is the one with bangs.” <br>
            “Okay. That’s nice to know,” replied Principal Olson.

            希金斯老师在三年级教室门口等着。“你好，卢克。你好，劳拉，”&nbsp;他说，“你们好，双胞胎。”&nbsp;<br>
            “凯蒂在这儿。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“我就是那个有刘海的。”&nbsp;她想：“今天会是个好日子。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mr. Higgins waited by the door to the third-grade classroom. <br>
            “Hello, Luke. Hello, Laura,” he said. “Hello, twins.” <br>
            “Katie here,” stated Katie. “I’m the one with bangs.” She thought, “It’s going to be a great day.”

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            今天的第一项活动是数学练习题。凯蒂错了三道除法题。乔伊算出了所有问题。在拼写课上，凯蒂把“cheese”&nbsp;中的S错拼成了Z。乔伊拼对了每个单词。到了艺术课的时候，凯蒂的泥马站不起来，但乔伊的泥羊看起来很完美。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first activity of the day was a math worksheet. Katie got three division problems wrong. Joy solved them all. During spelling time Katie spelled “cheese” with a z instead of an s. Joy spelled every word right. When it was time for art, Katie’s clay horse would not stand up. But Joy’s clay sheep looked perfect.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “今天这么好的一天，我是怎么了？”&nbsp;凯蒂想。她觉得事情会变得更糟。&nbsp;接下来是科学课，这意味着乔伊很快就会引起大家的注意。<br>
            首先，卢克给班上的同学们看他挖的一条吓人的蚯蚓。它有23厘米长！接下来，乔伊举起手来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today was such a great day—what's happening to me?” wondered Katie. She had a feeling that things would get worse. Science was next, and that meant Joy would soon have everyone’s attention. <br>
            First, Luke showed the class a creepy earthworm he dug up. It was 23 centimeters long! Next, Joy raised her hand.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂突然从座位上站了起来。“听我说！”&nbsp;<br>
            希金斯老师和全班同学看着凯蒂。<br>
            “我们要养小鸡了。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            她听到乔伊的叹气声。&nbsp;<br>
            “这是个特大新闻。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“它们会多大？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Katie jumped out of her seat. “I have something to say!” <br>
            Mr. Higgins and the class looked at Katie. <br>
            “We’re getting baby chickens,” said Katie. She heard Joy gasp. <br>
            “That’s big news,” said Mr. Higgins. “How old will they be?”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，它们真的很小。”&nbsp;凯蒂很快地说。&nbsp;<br>
            “一天。”&nbsp;乔伊回答。&nbsp;<br>
            希金斯老师转向乔伊。“哦。”&nbsp;他说。然后，他回头看着凯蒂。“你要养多少只小鸡？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Um, they’ll be really little,” Katie said quickly. <br>
            “One day old,” Joy answered. <br>
            Mr. Higgins turned to Joy. “Oh,” he said. Then he looked back at Katie. “How many chicks are you getting?”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “也许三只吧。”&nbsp;凯蒂回答。她看着乔伊，乔伊眯起眼睛看着凯蒂。<br>
            “六只。”&nbsp;乔伊纠正了她。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “小鸡吃什么？”&nbsp;希金斯老师问。<br>
            “你要养只公鸡吗？”&nbsp;卢克问。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe three,” replied Katie. She looked over at Joy, who narrowed her eyes at Katie. <br>
            “Six,” Joy corrected her. <br>
            “What do chicks eat?” asked Mr. Higgins. <br>
            “Are you getting a rooster?” asked Luke.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它们会想它们的妈妈吗？”&nbsp;劳拉问。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂为自己多嘴而感到很抱歉。她毁了乔伊的一切。现在，她连一个问题也答不上来。她看着乔伊。<br>
            “嗯。”&nbsp;乔伊接过话题说，“首先，它们会有特别的食物。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Will they miss their mother?” asked Laura. <br>
            Katie was sorry that she had opened her big mouth. She had ruined things for Joy. And now she couldn’t answer a single question. She looked over at Joy. <br>
            “Well,” Joy said, taking over, “first, they will have special feed.”<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她拿出她的小鸡目录。大家都聚在乔伊的书桌旁。<br>
            “这是我们挑选出来的小鸡。”&nbsp;她自豪地解释说。&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂静静地坐在自己的书桌旁听着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She pulled out her chicken catalog, and everyone gathered around Joy’s desk. <br>
            “These are the chicks we picked out,” she explained proudly. <br>
            Katie stayed at her desk, listening in silence.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            “The chicks' house needs a warming box,” explained Mom. She was sitting on the bed, reading from her library book How to Raise Chickens. “We need to put holes in the sides so air can flow through the box.”

            乔伊把一袋木屑倒进盒子里。当她把它们摊开时，爷爷把喂食器和水罐装满了鸡饲料和水。他把这两样东西放进盒子里。妈妈加了一个温度计。<br>
            “准备好了吗？”&nbsp;妈妈问道。<br>
            “准备好了！”&nbsp;乔伊叫道。&nbsp;

            Joy emptied a bag of wood shavings into the box. As she spread them out, Grandpa filled the feeder and the water jar. He put them in the box, and Mom added a thermometer. <br>

            “Ready!” cried Joy.

            Suddenly something flew through the air and landed right in the warming box!<br>

            "Let’s put them in the box before they get cold," suggested Grandpa. <br>
            One by one, Joy placed the chicks in the box.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy picked up a chick and put it next to the water feeder. "Look!" she exclaimed and clapped her hands. "It’s drinking!" <br>

            但凯蒂还是给了他一个大大的拥抱。“每个人都在看小鸡，爸爸。”&nbsp;她说，“但我在我的房间里还有事情要做。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie gave him a big hug anyway. "Everyone’s looking at the chicks, Dad," she said. "But I have work to do in my room." <br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The chicks had been drinking water and pecking at their food. But now they were getting quiet. One little chick tipped over on its side and lay completely still. <br>
            "What’s wrong?" asked Joy, worried. She poked the chick lightly with her finger. Its eyes popped open.<br>

            每个人都悄悄地走出了空房间。乔伊指着她在门上做的标志——“猫不许进来！”&nbsp;

            "The little one just fell asleep," whispered Grandpa. "She’s tired." <br>
            They watched the chicks fall asleep, one by one.<br>
            Joy put her finger to her lips. "Shh," she said. Everyone tiptoed out of the spare room. Joy pointed to a sign she had made for the door: "NO CATS ALLOWED!"

            在走廊另一头，凯蒂很努力地干着活。她在用胶带把一块红色塑料包在手电筒上。卢克告诉了她怎么做。杰利趴在凯蒂的床上看着凯蒂做的每一个动作。<br>
            “杰利。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“你知道澳大利亚的蚯蚓能长到三米半长吗？”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Down the hall Katie was hard at work. She was taping a piece of red plastic over a flashlight. Luke had told her how to do it. Jelly was sprawled on Katie’s bed watching every move Katie made.<br>
            "Jelly," said Katie, "did you know that earthworms in Australia can grow to be three and a half meters long?"<br>

            "HA! That’s how old I am," exclaimed Katie as she smoothed the tape into place. "There!" <br>
            She closed the curtains and turned off the light switch. Then Katie turned on the flashlight. A spooky red beam flashed around the room.<br>
            "Great!" she said. "I’m ready for worm hunting!"

            "Got it," said Luke. "It's a big one." He put the worm into his bucket. "Now you try."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂在卢克旁边弯下腰，很快发现了一条蚯蚓。<br>
            她伸出手去抓。<br>
            “抓到了！”&nbsp;她说。她举起手给卢克看。但她的手里是空的。“它逃走了！”&nbsp;她大喊道，“我的手黏糊糊的！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie stooped down beside Luke and quickly spotted an earthworm. She reached out and grabbed. <br>
            "Got it!" she said. She held her hand up to show Luke. But her hand was empty. "It got away!" she cried. "And my hand is all slimy!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这就是你的抹布的用途。”&nbsp;卢克解释道，“擦干你的手，再试一次。这次，抓它的中间部分。”&nbsp;<br>
            当凯蒂用抹布擦手时，她发现了另一条蚯蚓。她慢慢地伸出手去，抓住它的中间。她拽了一下。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's what your rag is for," explained Luke. "Dry your hand and try again. This time, grab it closer to the middle." <br>
            As Katie wiped her hand on her rag, she spotted another worm. She slowly stretched out her hand and grabbed it around its middle. She pulled.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它不出来。它还在挺着。”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            “继续拽。”&nbsp;卢克说，“蚯蚓会累的，然后就会放弃。”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂又拽了一会儿，直到蚯蚓滑了出来。<br>
            “哇！”&nbsp;她叫道，“我抓到了一条！”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “好吧。”&nbsp;卢克说，“把它扔进桶里。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It won't come out. It's holding on," she said.<br>
            "Keep pulling," Luke said. "The worm will get tired and let go." <br>
            Katie pulled some more until the earthworm came sliding out.<br>
            "Wow!" she exclaimed. "I got one!"<br>
            "Okay," said Luke. "Toss it in the bucket."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，凯蒂和卢克从后门跑进厨房。每个人都围坐在桌旁，爷爷在给大家分苹果派。<br>
            “我抓到蚯蚓了！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。<br>
            “不可以放在家里。”&nbsp;妈妈说。&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A little later, Katie and Luke ran through the back door, into the kitchen. Everyone was sitting around the table, and Grandpa was serving slices of apple pie.<br>
            "I've got worms!" shouted Katie.<br>
            "Not in the house," said Mom.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哦，对。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。她打开后门，把水桶放在门廊上。<br>
            “现在，在你吃苹果派之前，”&nbsp;妈妈说，<br>
            “先给卢克看看我们的新小鸡，怎么样？”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂叹了口气。她想聊聊她的蚯蚓。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh, right," said Katie. She opened the back door and set her bucket on the porch.<br>
            "Now, before you have your pie," said Mom, "why don't you show Luke our new chicks?"<br>
            Katie sighed. She wanted to talk about her worms.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “过来，卢克。”&nbsp;她轻声说。凯蒂带着表弟走出厨房，上了楼梯。<br>
            她打开空房间的门，把他拉到了那个小鸡温箱前。<br>
            “它们在这儿。”&nbsp;她说，“它们很可爱，但是很麻烦。你得喂它们，清理它们的臭鸡屎。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Come on, Luke," she said softly. Katie led her cousin out of the kitchen and up the stairs. She opened the door to the spare room and pulled him over to the chicks'warming box.<br>
            "There they are," she said. "They're cute, but a lot of trouble. You have to feed them and clean up their stinky poop."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “蚯蚓更有趣。”&nbsp;卢克说。<br>
            “那是肯定的。”&nbsp;凯蒂表示同意。“现在，我们去吃点苹果派吧。”&nbsp;<br>
            两个蚯蚓猎手没注意到走廊里有另一个猎手。杰利一直在黑暗中静静地等着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Worms are more fun," stated Luke.<br>
            "That's for sure," agreed Katie. "Now, let's go eat some pie."<br>
            The two worm hunters didn't notice another hunter in the hallway. Jelly had been waiting silently in the dark.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            它悄悄地朝空房间走去。门只开着一个缝。杰利把一只爪子放在门上推了推。<br>
            当门打开时，小鸡们在温箱里叽叽喳喳地叫着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She crept toward the spare room. The door had been left open just a crack. Jelly put one paw on the door and pushed. <br>
            The chicks chirped inside their box as the door swung open.<br>

            Jelly leaped up and landed on the desk. Luke tried to grab Jelly, but the cat leaped to the floor. Then Jelly ran out the door and down the hall. A white ball of fluff was in her mouth.<br>

            "Okay," said the teacher.<br>

            乔伊走到凯蒂的书桌旁。“你到前面画只小鸡。”&nbsp;她小声说。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            希金斯老师向凯蒂点了点头。她走到白板前。她拿起一个马克笔画了一只大鸡。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy stopped at Katie's desk. "Go ahead and draw the chicken," she whispered loudly.<br>
            Teaher Higgins nodded to Katie, and she walked to the whiteboard. She took a marker and drew a big chicken.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂刚画完尾巴，乔伊就大步走回了教室。爷爷拿着一个大纸盒跟在她后面。<br>
            “我们都向多诺万爷爷问好吧。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说。<br>
            三年级学生拍手叫道：“您好，多诺万爷爷！”&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just as Katie finished the tail, Joy marched back into the room. Grandpa walked behind her with a large cardboard box. <br>
            "Let's all say hello to Mr. Donovan," instructed Teacher Higgins. <br>
            The third graders clapped and called, "Hello, Mr. Donovan!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你们好，孩子们。”&nbsp;爷爷笑着说。他把盒子放在教室前面的一张桌子上。<br>
            然后，他坐在一把小椅子上。<br>
            “我已经看过小鸡了。”&nbsp;卢克小声对他旁边的男孩儿说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello, kids," Grandpa said, smiling. He carried the box to a table in the front of the room. Then he sat down on a small chair. <br>
            "I've already seen the chicks," Luke whispered to the boy next to him.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它们在叫！”&nbsp;劳拉喊道。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊走到教室前面，站在凯蒂旁边。<br>
            “我们要看看盒子里的小鸡。不过，首先凯蒂要给大家讲讲她的画。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They're cheeping!" cried Laura. <br>
            Joy walked to the front of the class and stood beside Katie. "We're going to look at the chicks in the box. But first Katie will tell you about her drawing."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “五六个月后，这些小鸡就会变成这样。这是一只成年母鸡，就是你们说的母鸡。”&nbsp;凯蒂向全班同学解释道，“这是母鸡的喙。”&nbsp;她指着白板。<br>
            “上面这个波浪状的东西叫做鸡冠。”&nbsp;她用手指敲了敲鸡冠。“喙下面这片松软的部分叫做肉垂。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "In five or six months, these little chicks will look like this. This is a grown-up hen. That's what you call a female chicken," Katie explained to the class. "Here is the hen's beak." She pointed to the whiteboard. "This wavy thing on top is called a comb." She tapped her finger on the comb. "And this floppy part under the beak is called a wattle."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真酷。”&nbsp;卢克说，“鸡爪在哪里？”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            全班同学都笑了。白板上没有地方了，凯蒂就没把鸡爪画出来。<br>
            “你真傻，卢克。”&nbsp;凯蒂回答道。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “谢谢你，凯蒂。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“这很有帮助。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Cool," said Luke. "Where are the feet?"<br>
            The whole class laughed. Katie had run out of space on the board and hadn't drawn the feet.<br>
            "You're silly, Luke," replied Katie. <br>
            "Thank you, Katie," said Teacher Higgins. "That was very helpful."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            现在，轮到乔伊了。“我们的小鸡还没长大。”&nbsp;她说，“它们大概有两个星期大。”&nbsp;她打开了盖子。所有三年级学生都从座位上站起来，聚到盒子周围。<br>
            “嘿！”&nbsp;卢克喊道，“它们的毛看起来很有趣，都立起来了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Now it was Joy's turn. "Our chicks aren't grown up yet," she said. "They're about two weeks old." She lifted the lid off the box. All the third graders jumped out of their seats and gathered around the box.<br>
            "Hey!" exclaimed Luke. "Their hair looks funny. It's sticking out."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            小鸡们在盒子里面又叫又跳。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊从盒子里拿出一只小鸡。“它们的尾巴和翅膀上有真羽毛。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这只有一个小角。”&nbsp;乔伊的一个同学大喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The chicks were cheeping and hopping around inside the box.<br>
            Joy lifted a chick from the box. "They're getting real feathers on their tails and wings." <br>
            "This one has little horns," exclaimed one of her classmates.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这就是它开始长鸡冠的地方。”&nbsp;乔伊解释说。<br>
            “为什么有些小鸡的腿是白的，有些小鸡的腿是黄的？”&nbsp;卢克问道。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “它们就是不一样而已。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “那两只白的小鸡是双胞胎吗？”&nbsp;劳拉问，“它们看起来很像。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That is where its comb is starting to grow," explained Joy. <br>
            "Why do some have white legs and some have yellow legs?" asked Luke.<br>
            "They're just different," said Joy.<br>
            "Are the two white ones twins?" asked Laura. "They look alike."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它们看起来很像，但不一样。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。她捧起一只白色的小鸡放在劳拉的手上。<br>
            “这只很好，很安静，但另一只......”&nbsp;<br>
            另一只白小鸡叽叽喳喳地叫着，跑来跑去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They look alike, but they're not the same," said Katie. She picked up one of the white chicks and put it in Laura's hand. "This one is nice and calm, but the other one―" <br>
            The other white chick chirped and ran around in circles.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            每个人都在盯着盒子看。这时，那只小鸡被喂食器绊倒了。它撞到了别的小鸡们。<br>
            “它在做什么？”&nbsp;卢克问道。<br>
            突然，一只小鸡尖叫着跳了起来，拍打着它的小翅膀。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Everyone looked closely into the box as the chick tripped over the feeder. It knocked into some of the other chicks.<br>
            "What's it doing?" asked Luke.<br>
            Suddenly the squawking chick jumped and flapped its little wings.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它想飞！”&nbsp;劳拉叫道。<br>
            所有的孩子都笑了。<br>
            “看见没？”&nbsp;乔伊说，“小鸡们长得很像，但它们各不相同。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It's trying to fly!" cried Laura.<br>
            All the children laughed.<br>

            所有三年级学生都鼓掌欢呼。凯蒂和乔伊微笑着对视。然后，她们也欢呼了起来！

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Just like us!" Katie couldn't help saying.<br>

            三年级学生们不安静。他们想在户外玩儿，而不是坐在教室里。<br>
            希金斯老师站在教室前面。“春天会发生什么事？”&nbsp;他问道。<br>
            “我们做暑假计划！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The third graders were restless. They wanted to be playing outdoors, not sitting in the classroom.<br>
            Teacher Higgins stood in front of the class. "What happens in spring?" he asked.<br>
            "We plan for summer vacation!" said Katie.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“但现在还不是时候，凯蒂。谁还有别的答案？”&nbsp;<br>
            “开花！”&nbsp;劳拉说。<br>
            “鸟筑巢！”&nbsp;乔伊说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "True," said Teacher Higgins. "But it's not time for that yet, Katie. Who has another answer?"<br>
            "Flowers bloom!" said Laura. <br>
            "Birds build nests!" said Joy.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “很好。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“天气怎么样？”&nbsp;<br>
            “阳光灿烂，很暖和。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，充满期待地望着窗外。&nbsp;<br>
            “但有时会有暴风雨。”&nbsp;卢克说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Good," said Teacher Higgins. "What about the weather?"<br>
            "Sunny and warm," Katie said, looking out the window with anticipation.<br>

            “龙卷风！”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。他家离卢克家不远，只隔着两座房子。<br>
            “没错。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“旋风或龙卷风，通常在春天发生。谁能说说龙卷风是什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Tornadoes!" said Carlos Ramirez. He lived two houses down from Luke. <br>
            "That's right," said Teacher Higgins. "Twisters, or tornadoes, often strike in the spring. Who can explain what a tornado is?"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            卡洛斯又开口了。“这是一股旋转的强风。它的形状像一个漏斗，在暴风云下。龙卷风可以带走一头牛或一辆校车。它甚至可以把房子吹到空中！”&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Carlos spoke up again. "It's a strong wind that spins around and around. It's shaped like a funnel, and it hangs down from a storm cloud. A tornado can carry off a cow or a school bus. It can even lift a house up in the air!"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “龙卷风非常危险。”&nbsp;希金斯老师表示同意。“这就是我们每年为春天做准备的原因。我们练习龙卷风来时，该怎么做。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们要进行龙卷风演习吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂满怀期待地问道。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “是的，凯蒂，以后。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“现在，谁还记得龙卷风警报的声音？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Tornadoes are very dangerous," agreed Teacher Higgins. "That's why every spring we prepare. We practice what to do if a tornado comes."<br>
            "Are we going to have a tornado drill?" Katie asked hopefully. <br>
            "Yes, Katie. Later," said Teacher Higgins. "Now who remembers what the tornado alarm sounds like?"<br>

            Back in the classroom, Teacher Higgins passed out a paper to each student. "We'll finish our posters later. This is a list of things you can do at home to get ready for tornado season," he said. "You should each organize a Family Tornado Safety Team." <br>
            "Cool," said Luke.

            "First, let's pick our shelter. It should be someplace below the ground."<br>
            "I guess we should use the cellar," said Grandpa. "Just like we always have."<br>
            "Good thinking," said Katie. "That was easy! Next, we need a radio and a flashlight."<br>

            乔伊坐了回去，转动着眼珠。&nbsp;凯蒂又开始指手画脚了。<br>
            “树屋？”&nbsp;凯蒂想。她把手放在额头上闭上了眼睛。“我有个好主意。”&nbsp;她一下子睁开了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy sat back down, rolling her eyes. Katie was being bossy again.<br>
            "A tree house?" thought Katie. She put her hand on her forehead and closed her eyes. "I'm getting a brilliant idea." Her eyes flew open.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的！”&nbsp;她喊道，“多诺万龙卷风安全小组需要一个树屋！这会是一个气象观测站！”&nbsp;她转向乔伊。“盖一个！”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊迅速向凯蒂敬礼。“是，组长！”&nbsp;她笑着说。凯蒂有时可能很霸道。不过，她也很有趣！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes!" she shouted. "The Donovan Tornado Safety Team needs a tree house! It will be a weather lookout station!" She turned to her sister. "Build it!"<br>
            Joy gave Katie a quick salute. "Aye, Captain!" she said, laughing. Katie might be bossy at times. But she could be funny too!<br>

            Aunt Sally laughed as she brushed the flour from her apron and said, "I guess if a tornado comes, we'll just blow away!"<br>

            妈妈和卢克也笑了。凯蒂皱着眉头摇了摇头。她是唯一一个认真对待这件事的人。<br>
            与此同时，乔伊和爸爸在多诺万池塘上方的山坡上看着树。他们刚在两棵榆树停下了。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mom and Luke laughed too. Katie frowned and shook her head. She was the only one who seemed to be taking this seriously.<br>
            Meanwhile Joy and Dad were on the slope above the Donovan pond looking at trees. They had just stopped under two elms.<br>

            “这两棵树也许可以。”&nbsp;爸爸说，“我们看看它们相距多远。”&nbsp;他从工具带上拿下一个卷尺。“在这儿，你把卷尺的一端放在这棵树上。”&nbsp;他对乔伊说。然后，他走向另一棵树，一边走一边拉着卷尺。”&nbsp;一米二。刚好。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "These two trees might work," said Dad. "Let's see how far apart they are." He took a tape measure from his tool belt. "Here, hold your end of the tape on this tree," he said to Joy. Then he walked to the other tree, pulling the tape as he went. "One meter and twenty centimeters. Perfect," he said.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是一个非常适合树屋的地方。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“从这里，我们可以看到池塘、房子、鸡圈......&nbsp;所有的一切！”&nbsp;<br>
            “这两棵树会支撑住树屋的后面。”&nbsp;他说，“我们要用两个柱子支撑前面。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And this is a perfect spot for a tree house," said Joy. "From here, we can see the pond, the house, the chicken coop—everything!" <br>
            "The two trees will hold up the back of the tree house," he said. "And we'll use two posts to hold up the front."<br>

            乔伊转向房子，看见凯蒂和麦古在朝山上跑过来。<br>

            Joy turned toward the house and saw Katie and Magoo racing up the hill.<br>
            "Katie and Mom are back," she said. <br>

            “这是一个完美的地方，是吧？”&nbsp;乔伊说。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂点了点头。“这里棒极了。”&nbsp;她说，“我可以看到暴风云从西南方向滚滚而来。你知道，龙卷风就是从那里来的。”&nbsp;她抬头朝晴朗的天空望去。

            "Isn't this a perfect spot?" said Joy. <br>
            Katie nodded. "It's excellent," she said. "I'll be able to watch the storm clouds roll in from the southwest. That's where tornadoes come from, you know." She looked up into the clear blue sky.<br>

            “钉子。”&nbsp;爸爸说。乔伊把手伸进她的袋子里。<br>
            “钉子！”&nbsp;她边说边递给他一个。爸爸用锤子把它敲进木板里。“干得好！”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            乔伊和爸爸一上午都很忙。他们把爷爷的木头搬到了有榆树的那个地方。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Nail," said Dad. Joy reached into her sack. <br>
            "Nail!" she said, handing him one. Dad pounded it into a board with his hammer. "Good job!" said Joy.<br>
            Joy and her dad had been busy all morning. They had moved Grandpa's wood up to the elm trees.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，他们在木场买了更多的木板和木桩。爸爸在地上放了两根柱子，为树屋的地板做了一个框架。<br>
            当他结束时，他皱着眉头看着乔伊。<br>
            “搭档。”&nbsp;他说：“我们有个问题。”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then they bought more wooden boards and posts at the lumberyard. Dad put two posts in the ground and built a frame for the tree house floor. <br>
            When he was finished, he looked at Joy with a frown. "Partner," he said, "we have a problem."<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “怎么了？”&nbsp;乔伊惊讶地问。<br>
            “你看我们买的地板木头。”&nbsp;爸爸指着12块木板说，“它们有两米半长。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊看了看木板，然后抬头看了看爸爸做的框架。她歪着头，眯起了眼睛。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's wrong?" asked Joy with surprise.<br>
            "See this wood we bought for the floor?" said Dad, pointing at a pile of 12 boards. "They are two and a half meters long."<br>
            Joy looked at the boards and then looked up at the frame Dad had built. She tilted her head and narrowed her eyes.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，她笑了。“那些木板看起来太长了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的眼力很好！”&nbsp;爸爸说，“这个框架有两米长，所以我们需要把每块木板缩短半米。”&nbsp;<br>
            爸爸和乔伊跪在一块木板旁。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then she smiled. "Those boards look too long." <br>
            "You've got a good set of eyes!" said Dad. "The frame is two meters long, so we need to shorten each board by half a meter." <br>
            Dad and Joy knelt by one board.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “把这个卷尺放在木板的末端。”&nbsp;爸爸边说边把卷尺递给她。<br>
            然后，他沿着边缘拉长卷尺。<br>
            “这是25厘米。”&nbsp;乔伊说。爸爸又把卷尺拉长了一些。“这是50厘米！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hold this tape measure at the end of the board," Dad said, handing her the measure. Then he pulled the tape along the edge. <br>
            "That's 25 centimeters," said Joy. Dad pulled the tape some more. "And that's 50!"<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在，我用铅笔做记号。”&nbsp;爸爸一边解释一边画了一条黑线。“我们就在这儿割板子。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们需要测量并标记全部木板吗？”&nbsp;乔伊问道。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;爸爸说，“然后，我就把它们裁成合适的尺寸。还有，你知道吗？我们可以把剩下的木头送到回收中心。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Now I mark it with a pencil," explained Dad as he drew a black line. "That's where we will cut the board."<br>
            "Should we measure and mark all of them?" asked Joy.<br>
            "Yes," said Dad. "Then I'll cut them down to the right size. And you know what? We can take the leftover wood to the recycling center."<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “其他人也许能用得上。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“就像我们用爷爷的木头一样。”&nbsp;<br>
            到了下午晚些时候，爸爸已经把树屋的地板钉在框架上了。他和乔伊坐在卡车的尾部，抬头看着他们的成果。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Somebody else will be able to use it," said Joy. "Just like we used Grandpa's wood."<br>
            By late afternoon Dad had finished nailing the tree house floor to the frame. He and Joy sat on the back end of the truck and looked up at their work.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “接下来我们做什么？”&nbsp;乔伊问道。<br>
            “我们回收多余的木头。我们还可以找到一些我们需要的东西。”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            他们坐上卡车，朝山下公路开去。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's next?" asked Joy.<br>
            "Let's recycle that extra wood. We might find a few things we need too," said Dad. They got in the truck and drove down the hill to the road.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            当他们到达中心时，乔伊跳下了车。她喜欢抬头看堆成山的碎纸板和破汽水罐。她看到了卡洛斯的爸爸——雷斯先生。他负责整理所有的铜、锡、铁和钢。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When they reached the center, Joy hopped out of the truck. She liked looking up at the mountains of shredded cardboard and smashed soda cans. She saw Mr.Reiss, Carlos' father. He was in charge of sorting all the metal—brass, tin, iron, steel, and copper.

            “我们可能需要。”&nbsp;乔伊回答道，“谢谢您！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello, Mr.Reiss," called Joy. "Dad and I are building a tree house! Do you have anything we can use?" <br>
            "Well, let's see," said Mr.Reiss. "Do you need a bucket?"<br>
            "We might," replied Joy. "Thanks!"<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            爸爸在看一个纸板箱。“这里有一些旧钩子。”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “孩子们可以把东西挂在上面。”&nbsp;雷斯先生说。乔伊把钩子扔进了她的桶里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Dad was looking in a cardboard box. "Here are some old hooks," he said. <br>
            "The kids can hang stuff on those," said Mr.Reiss. Joy dropped the hooks into her bucket.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是什么？”&nbsp;乔伊问道，“轮子？”&nbsp;<br>
            “这是一种特殊的轮子。”&nbsp;雷斯先生说，“它叫做滑轮。你可以用它和绳子把东西拉起来。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊转向爸爸。“我们需要一个吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “拿上它。”&nbsp;他说，“我们可以用它。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's this?" asked Joy. "A wheel?"<br>
            "It's a special kind of wheel," said Mr.Reiss. "It's called a pulley. You use it with a rope to help lift something."<br>
            Joy turned to her dad. "Do we need one?" <br>
            "Take it," he said. "We can use it."<br>

            “这根杆子我们也拿着吧。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“这可能用得着。”&nbsp;<br>

            "Let's take this pole too," said Joy. "It might be good for something."<br>
            Then Dad found some sheets of tin leaning against a wall.<br>
            "Our tree house roof!" cried Joy.<br>

            那并不是全部。他们还发现了一个小窗框和一扇旧门。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And that wasn't all. They also found a small window frame and an old door.<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Pieces of the tin roof were spread on the grass. Dad opened a can of dark blue paint. "Here's a brush," he said to Joy. "Do you want to help, Katie?" <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy dipped her brush into the paint and carefully painted the first piece of tin.<br>

            "Get out of here," cried Joy. "You'll spill the paint." <br>
            Magoo leaped back and sat down again. <br>

            Magoo watched Joy paint. His eyes were fixed on the brush as it moved back and forth. Then he reached out and touched the brush with his paw.<br>

            The next afternoon, Dad put in the door and the window. Finally he nailed down the roof.<br>

            "Put it in the bucket, Mom!" Joy shouted from the tree house. The bucket was sitting on the ground with a rope tied to its handle. The rope was attached to the pulley, which was attached to the roof. Mom set the flowers in the bucket.

            "That's right," Katie said. "But when the wind is strong, the wind sock flies straight out!" Katie paused and opened her eyes extra wide. "And if that wind is coming from the southwest, look out! It might be tornado time!"<br>
            "That's pretty cool, Katie," said Joy. "Thanks!"<br>

            两周后，双胞胎坐在树屋里。“一只蜜蜂有多少个眼睛？”&nbsp;凯蒂问道。凯蒂正在读一本关于蜜蜂的书。乔伊在给杰利刷毛。<br>

            Two weeks later, the twins were sitting in the tree house. "How many eyes does a bee have?" asked Katie. Katie was reading a book about bees. Joy was brushing Jelly.<br>

            Outside, Katie and Joy saw a broken flowerpot and a twisted folding chair. A section of the garden fence was missing. Everywhere they looked, tree branches were on the ground . <br>

            “喂，卡洛斯。”&nbsp;凯蒂想了一下，说道，“人们不应该喜欢龙卷风。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning at school, everyone was talking about the tornado.  <br>
            "It went right over Willow Creek!" exclaimed Carlos. "It was great!"<br>
            "Oh, Carlos," said Katie, rolling her eyes. "People aren't supposed to like tornados."<br>

            “凯蒂是我们的组长。”&nbsp;乔伊说，对着凯蒂笑。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Well, I do," said Carlos.<br>
            "Tell me about your family tornado safety teams," Teacher Higgins said. "Did you all have a plan?"<br>

            “乔伊在风暴过后找到了杰利！”&nbsp;凯蒂宣布道。<br>
            “嗯，爸爸和我找到的。”&nbsp;乔伊害羞地说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Everybody worked together," added Katie. "Mom and I made a first aid kit."<br>

            "And Joy found Jelly after the storm!" Katie announced. <br>
            "Well, Dad and I did," said Joy shyly.<br>

            “我家没有避难所。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说，“所以，我们决定走廊是最安全的地方。因为那里没有窗户。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My house doesn't have a cellar," said Carlos. "So we decided that a hallway would be the safest place. There are no windows there."<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "My dad actually saw the tornado," said Larry. "We all went down into the storm cellar. But just before Dad shut the door, he looked up. The tornado was coming right across the field! Our barn went up in the air and crashed down hard. It broke into a hundred pieces."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>

            “拉里，你说你的谷仓被毁了，我很难过。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说。全班同学点了点头。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Were there any cows in the barn?" asked Carlos. <br>
            "No," said Larry, "just my bicycle. We haven't found it yet."  <br>
            "Larry, I'm sorry to hear your barn was destroyed," said Teacher Higgins. The class nodded.<br>

    </div>
    <div>

            “没关系。”&nbsp;拉里说，“我们的邻居今天过来了。他们会帮我爸爸建一个新谷仓。”&nbsp;<br>
            “太好了。”&nbsp;希金斯老师说，“人们一起合作时，会非常有帮助。”&nbsp;接着，希金斯老师问拉里龙卷风的声音听起来像什么。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thank you," said Larry. "But our neighbors are coming over today. They're going to help Dad build a new barn."<br>
            "That's great," said Teacher Higgins. "It's a big help when people work together." Then Teacher Higgins asked Larry what the tornado sounded like.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            拉里想了一会儿。“听起来像......就像一个......”&nbsp;<br>

            “它甚至像火车一样鸣笛！”&nbsp;乔伊说，“呜呜！&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            “我觉得听起来像喷气式飞机。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说，“轰隆！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Larry thought for a moment. "It sounded like . . . like a . . ."<br>
            "Like a train!" said Katie. "Roar!" <br>
            "It even whistled like a train!" said Joy. "Woo-woo!"<br>
            "I think it sounded like a jet plane," said Carlos. "Varoom!"<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “它发出了响声。”&nbsp;劳拉说，“就像我们把窗打开，然后车开得飞快。嗖！”&nbsp;<br>
            “就像一只野生动物......一头狮子！”&nbsp;卢克说，“嗷！”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            每个人都开始发出可怕的声音。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It made a noise," said Laura, "like when we go fast in the car with the windows down. Whoosh!"<br>
            "It was like a wild animal . . . a lion!" said Luke. "Grr!" <br>
            Everybody started making scary sounds.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “逃生！”&nbsp;凯蒂大喊道。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            她的话把大家都逗笑了。<br>
            突然，希金斯老师挥了挥手。“请安静！”&nbsp;他大喊道，“安静！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "TAKE COVER!" cried Katie. <br>
            That made everybody laugh.<br>
            Suddenly Teacher Higgins waved his arms. "Quiet, please!" he called. "Quiet!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            他们听到敲门声，奥尔森校长走进教室。她看着希金斯老师。“我从走廊走来时，好像听见了龙卷风声。”&nbsp;她说。大家又都笑了。奥尔森校长也笑了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They heard a knock on the door, and Principal Olson stepped into the classroom. She looked at Teacher Higgins. "I thought I heard a tornado as I came down the hall," she said. Everybody laughed again, and Principal Olson smiled.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “希金斯老师。”&nbsp;她说，“学校院子里满是在暴风雨中被吹倒的树枝。你们班愿意帮忙打扫操场吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “好的！”&nbsp;所有学生都大喊道。“我们要帮忙！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Teacher Higgins," she said. "The school yard is covered with tree branches that were blown down during the storm. Would your class like to help clean up the playground?" <br>
            "Yes!" cried all the boys and girls. "We'll help!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            所以，课间休息的时候，希金斯老师把全班同学带到了操场。他们把所有的树枝堆成一大堆。希金斯老师搬着沉重的树枝。劳拉帮乔伊搬着一根大树枝。卡洛斯找到一只蓝色运动鞋。凯蒂在滑梯下发现一把破伞。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            So when recess came, Teacher Higgins led the class out to the playground. They gathered all the branches into a big pile. Teacher Higgins carried the heavy branches. Laura helped Joy carry a big branch. Carlos found one blue sneaker. Katie found a broken umbrella under the slide.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，孩子们站在他们的“树枝堆”&nbsp;前。奥尔森校长拍了一张照片。第二天，她把照片钉在走廊的布告板上。在照片下面，她用大头针固定了几个大字：团队合作愉快。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then the kids stood in front of their mountain of tree limbs. Principal Olson took a photo. The next day, she put the photo on the bulletin board in the hall. Under the photo, she pinned up big letters that spelled "TEAMWORK WORKS!"

            凯蒂在想着亨德森奶奶。她八岁的时候沿着小溪散过步吗？

            The next morning, Teacher Kov led the campers on a hike along Willow Creek. She showed them turtle eggs. She showed them a lizard sleeping in the sun. The kids picked wildflowers. <br>
            Katie was thinking about Ms. Henderson. Did she walk along the creek when she was eight years old?<br>

            那时候，小溪是什么样子的呢？<br>
            突然，艾米丽抓住了凯蒂的胳膊。“你听到了吗？”&nbsp;她低声说。“龙卷风小组今天要去养老院找最年长的人。”&nbsp;<br>
            “哈！”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“他们在那里永远找不到她！”&nbsp;

            What did the creek look like back then?<br>
            Suddenly Emily grabbed Katie's arm. "Did you hear?" she whispered. "The Tornadoes are going to the senior home today to look for the oldest person." <br>
            "HA!" said Katie. "They'll never find her there!"<br>

            "A what nut necklace?" said Katie.<br>

            第二天早上，凯蒂和乔伊飞快地跑进教室。她们刚坐到椅子上，上课铃就响了。<br>
            凯蒂看了看右边。卢克在小声说话，奥利维亚在笑。凯蒂翻了个白眼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning, Katie and Joy hurried to their classroom. They sat down in their seats just as the bell rang.<br>
            Katie looked to her right. Luke was whispering; Olivia was laughing. Katie rolled her eyes.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“好，各位同学。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“拿出你们的铅笔和本子，我们开始学习。这是四年级的数学书！”&nbsp;<br>
            卡洛斯低头看了看课本封面，他看见一个圆盘被等分成了八块。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Okay, students," said Teacher Barrow. "Take out your pencils and notebooks. Let’s get to work. Here are your fourth-grade math books!" <br>
            Carlos looked down at the cover of his book. He saw a disk that was cut into eight equal pieces.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我知道这个图片是什么意思！”&nbsp;他嘟囔着，“要学更多的分数！”&nbsp;<br>
            “今天不学分数，卡洛斯。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“今天我们要学整数——数值大的整数。还要学习数十的倍数。我们也许能数到一百万！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I know what this picture means!" he groaned. "More fractions!" <br>
            "No fractions today, Carlos," said Teacher Barrow. "Today we will learn about whole numbers with reallybig numbers. Then we'll learn to count in tens. We may even count to a million!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            数学课后是科学课。贝柔老师给每个学生发了一本叫做《两栖动物》的书。<br>
            奥利维亚指了指封面上的青蛙，“这像是黑绿相间的箭毒蛙！它们住在夏威夷！”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            “真能装聪明。”&nbsp;凯蒂想。&nbsp;她哗哗地翻起了书。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After math came science. Teacher Barrow gave each student a book called 《Amphibians》. <br>
            Olivia pointed to the frog on the cover. "This looks like a green-and-black poison dart frog! They live in Hawaii!" she said.<br>
            "Smarty-pants," thought Katie. She flipped through the book.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “乌龟在哪儿？”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道，“三趾箱龟就住在我家后院。”&nbsp;<br>
            “听上去很有趣！”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“不过，乌龟不是两栖动物，凯蒂，乌龟是爬行动物。”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂的脸红了。“哎呀。”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where are the turtles?" she called out. "A three-toed box turtle lives right in our backyard."  <br>
            "That’s interesting," said Teacher Barrow. "But turtles are not amphibians, Katie. Turtles are reptiles."  <br>
            Katie’s face turned red. "Oops," she said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            科学课后，贝柔老师宣布要做一个有关健康的发表活动。“从现在开始，我们应该关注健康问题。”&nbsp;她说，“如果你能照顾好你自己，你就会拥有一个好心情，也会更长寿。”&nbsp;贝柔老师给每个人发了一本叫做《健康管理》的书。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After science Teacher Barrow announced a health presentation activity. "From now we have to pay attention to health issues," she said. "When you take good care of yourself, you feel good, and you may live longer too. "Teacher Barrow gave everyone a book called !《Health Management》.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “下个星期，大家都要到前边发表。”&nbsp;老师接着说，“你们要在这本书里选择一个主题。我希望你们能够充分发挥想象力，写出一份更有意思的发表。”&nbsp;然后，她让每个学生从一个盒子里抽出一张纸条。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Next week everyone will do a presentation in front of the class." The teacher went on, "You will tell us about one topic in this book. And I hope you use your imagination to make a moreinteresting and fun presentation." Then she asked each student to pull a slip of paper from a box.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            奥利维亚是第一个，她打开了纸条。“健康的皮肤”&nbsp;她说。劳拉抽到了&nbsp;“健康的眼睛”&nbsp;，卢克抽到了&nbsp;“营养”&nbsp;。<br>
            卡洛斯打开他的纸条。“健康的耳朵”&nbsp;他说。<br>
            “什么？我听不见你说什么。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。没人笑。她看了看四周。“明白了吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Olivia was first. She opened her paper. "Healthy Skin," she read. Laura drew Healthy Eyes. Luke got Nutrition.<br>
            Carlos unfolded his paper. "Healthy Ears," he said.<br>
            "What? I can’t hear you?" said Katie. Nobody laughed. She looked around. "Get it?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “明白了。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。<br>
            拉里抽到了&nbsp;“安全运动”&nbsp;。然后，有人抽到了&nbsp;“睡眠与休息”&nbsp;。下一个该凯蒂了，她把手伸进了盒子。<br>
            “运动”&nbsp;凯蒂读着纸条，“嘿，这和&nbsp;‘玩儿’&nbsp;是一样的，不是吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            贝柔老师笑了。“是的，凯蒂，有些人也会那么认为。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We get it," said Carlos.<br>
            Larry got Sports Safety. Then someone pulled out Sleep and Rest. Next it was Katie’s turn. She reached into the box.<br>
            "Exercise," she read the note. "Hey, that’s the same as playing, isn’t it?" <br>
            Teacher Barrow smiled. "Some people think of it that way. Yes, Katie."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            最后，该乔伊了。“建立友谊？”&nbsp;她说，“这也是和健康有关的主题吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“朋友可以帮助我们相信自己，这也是保持健康的一个重要部分。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Finally it was Joy’s turn. "Building Friendships?" she said. "Is this a health topic?"<br>
            "Yes," said Teacher Barrow. "Friends help us feel good about ourselves. That’s a very important part of being healthy."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好的！”&nbsp;乔伊说。她喜欢她的主题。关于&nbsp;“友谊”&nbsp;的发表一定会很有趣的。<br>
            “今天的课就上到这儿，同学们。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“请在铃响前把东西收拾好。”&nbsp;<br>
            很快，四年级的学生们就冲出了教学楼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Okay," said Joy. She liked her topic. It would be fun to do a presentation on friendship.<br>
            "That’s all for today's class, students," said Teacher Barrow. "Please clean up before the bell rings."<br>
            Soon the fourth graders were rushing out of the building.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “今天还不错。”&nbsp;凯蒂对乔伊说，“我们俩的健康主题似乎都很有趣。”&nbsp;<br>
            这时，凯蒂听见卢克用尖尖的声音喊道：“贝柔老师，乌龟在哪儿？”&nbsp;除了凯蒂，所有的同学都大笑起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Today wasn't bad," said Katie to Joy. "Both of our health topics sound fun."<br>
            Then Katie heard Luke speaking in a high, squeaky voice. "Teacher Barrow, where are the turtles?" Except for Katie, all of the students laughed.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那不好笑，卢克！”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            有些同学想不笑，但他们没忍住。<br>
            “他只是在开玩笑，凯蒂。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “别生气。”&nbsp;卢克说，“喂！我有一个好主意，我们都去&nbsp;‘脆皮派天堂’&nbsp;吧。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That’s not funny, Luke!" she said.<br>
            Some kids tried to stop laughing, but they couldn’t. <br>
            "He’s only teasing, Katie," said Joy.<br>
            "Don’t be mad," said Luke. "Hey! I’ve got an idea. Let’s all go to Crispy Pie Heaven."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂还是很生气。“和你？不了，谢谢！”&nbsp;她说。然后，她骑上自己的自行车，飞快地沿着校园马路骑走了。<br>
            “凯蒂肯定生气了。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。<br>
            “她是生气了。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “我从来没听说过脆皮派。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“什么是脆皮派？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But Katie was still angry at her cousin. "With you? No thanks!" she said. Then she got on her bike and sped down School Street. <br>
            "I think she’s upset," said Carlos. <br>
            "I know she’s upset," said Joy. <br>
            "I’ve never heard of fried pies," said Olivia. "What are they?"

            “我们比赛吧！”&nbsp;卢克说，“各就各位，预备，出发！”&nbsp;
        </div>

            That night after dinner, Mom washed the dishes and Joy dried them. "My report will be about building friendships. I’ve already read my section of the book and researched relevant information on the topic on the internet," Joy explained to her family. "Katie’s topic is exercise."

            星期六早上，乔伊坐在桌子前写发表。她正在网上读一篇叫做《做朋友》的文章。可是现在，她关上了妈妈的笔记本电脑，坐在那里思考。<br>
            “你在想什么呢？”&nbsp;爷爷问。乔伊抬头看着爷爷微笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On Saturday morning, Joy sat at the kitchen table writing her report. She had been reading an article on the Internet called "Being a Friend." But now she closed Mom’s laptop and sat thinking.<br>
            "What’s on your mind?" asked Grandpa. Joy looked up and grinned.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我有一个好主意。”&nbsp;她说，“我马上就回来！”&nbsp;乔伊跑出厨房。当她回来时，她抱着一堆美术用品。<br>
            “呼！”&nbsp;乔伊边说边把所有的东西扔到了餐桌上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I’ve got a great idea," she said. "I’ll be right back!" Joy ran out of the kitchen. When she returned, her arms were loaded with art supplies. <br>
            "Whew!" she said, dumping everything on the kitchen table.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你要做什么？”&nbsp;爷爷问。他拿着一个大勺子在燃气灶上的锅里搅着。<br>
            “我的特别发明！”&nbsp;乔伊笑着说。<br>
            首先，她从纸板上剪下了一个桨形。然后，她用黑纸剪出了一个指针。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What are you going to make?" asked Grandpa. He stirred the pot on the stove with a big spoon.<br>
            "My own special invention!" Joy laughed. <br>
            First, she cut a paddle from cardboard. Then, she cut a pointer from black paper.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她把指针固定在纸板上后，转了几下。<br>
            “太完美了！”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            爷爷尝了一口锅里的汤。“放一点盐的话，这个鸡汤也会很完美的。不知道凯蒂会不会按时回家吃午饭。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She fastened the pointer to the cardboard and gave it a spin.<br>
            "Perfect!" she said.<br>
            Grandpa sipped a mouthful of soup from the pot. "With a little salt, this chicken soup should be perfect too. I wonder if Katie will make it home in time for lunch."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊在纸板上画了两个大圆点，一个用的是绿色马克笔，一个用的是红色马克笔。然后，她在绿圆点上画了一张笑脸，在红圆点上画了一张哭脸，又在纸板边上画上了蓝色的波浪线。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy drew two big dots on the cardboard, one with a green marker and one with a red marker. Then she drew a smiley face on the green dot and a frowning face on the red dot. She drew blue wavy lines along the edges of the cardboard.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她拿起自己的作品欣赏着。“画完了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “午饭也做好了！”&nbsp;爷爷说。他给乔伊盛了一碗汤放在桌上。他看着乔伊的发明，挠了挠头。“看起来很好，不过......这是什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She held up her work to admire it. "It’s done!"<br>
            "And so is lunch!" Grandpa said. He placed a bowl of soup for Joy on the table. He looked at her invention and scratched his head. "It looks good, but . . . what is it?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是一个友谊测定仪！”&nbsp;乔伊说。她用大拇指把指针转向绿圆点。“它在笑，因为爷爷您是最好的朋友！”&nbsp;<br>
            然后，乔伊看了看钟表。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It’s a friendship meter!" said Joy. With her thumb, she moved the pointer to the green dot. "And it’s smiling—because you, Grandpa, are the best friend a person could have!" <br>
            Then Joy looked at the clock.
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我要收拾东西了。”&nbsp;她说，“快到一点了，差不多快到方块舞的排练时间了！”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂正在柳树溪图书馆写她的发表。她找到了两本书，一本是《弯曲和伸展》，另一本是《快乐健身》。&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I better clean up," she said. "It’s almost one o’clock—almost time for square-dance practice!"<br>
            Katie was working on her report at the Willow Creek library. She had found a book called 《Bend and Stretch》 and another called 《Fitness for Fun》.

            “戴格斯特叔叔，肌肉可真有趣。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。戴格斯特叔叔是星期六的图书馆管理员。“你知道人们伸舌头需要一块特殊的肌肉吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂对戴格斯特叔叔伸出了舌头。&nbsp;戴格斯特动了动眼镜，看着凯蒂。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Muscles are very interesting, Mr. Dexter," Katie said. Mr. Dexter was the Saturday librarian. "Did you know there is a special muscle for sticking out your tongue?" Katie stuck out her tongue for Mr. Dexter. Mr. Dexter looked at Katie over the top of his glasses.

            “确实有趣。”&nbsp;戴格斯特叔叔说。他继续翻找图书馆的音乐光盘。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That is interesting," said Mr. Dexter. He continued searching through the library’s music CDs.<br>

            凯蒂把所有东西都放进了她的背包，然后看了一眼手表。该走了！“戴格斯特叔叔，谢谢您的帮助。”&nbsp;说完，凯蒂转过了身。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Great!" said Katie. She opened the CD case and looked at the square-dance dance instructions. "I’ll take it!"<br>

            Katie was telling Olivia about ticks. "They are related to spiders," Katie told Olivia,  "And they are awful! Once they get on you, they crawl all over your skin until they find a nice spot and—this is the worst part—they bite you and suck your blood!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “什么？”&nbsp;奥利维亚喊道，“太可怕了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “没错！”&nbsp;凯蒂傻笑着说。<br>
            “城里没有蜱虫。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。<br>
            “嗯，现在你在乡下，最好小心点。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “所以，我应该在我的健康皮肤发表里加上蜱虫的内容？”&nbsp;奥利维亚问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What?" cried Olivia. "That’s horrible!" <br>
            "Right!" said Katie with a silly smile.<br>
            "We didn’t have ticks in the city," said Olivia.<br>
            "Well, now you’re in the country. You’d better watch out!" said Katie. <br>
            "So I should put ticks in my report about healthy skin?" asked Olivia.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “当然了。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“蜱虫以及怎么避开它们。”&nbsp;<br>
            “真庆幸跟你聊了聊。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“我还得再加上点儿别的什么吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂想了一会儿。“你对毒藤了解多少？”&nbsp;她问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Definitely," said Katie. "Ticks and how to avoid them."<br>
            "I’m so glad I talked to you," said Olivia. "What else should I include?"<br>
            Katie thought a moment. "How much do you know about poison ivy?" she asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “不太了解。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。<br>
            凯蒂摇了摇头。“嗯，毒藤到处疯长。”&nbsp;她说，“如果你的皮肤不小心接触到它，刚好你对植物油又过敏的话，那你的麻烦就大了。&nbsp;首先，皮肤会过敏。然后，就会扩散，长红包，会痒好几天！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Not much," said Olivia. <br>
            Katie shook her head. "Well, it grows wild all over the place," she said. "If it touches your skin and you’re allergic to the plant’s oil, you’re in big trouble. First, you get it in one spot. Then, it usually spreads, and you get red bumps that itch like crazy for days!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “毒藤长什么样子？”&nbsp;奥利维亚问，“蜱虫又长什么样子呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们找一些照片吧！”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“那样你就可以做成很酷的海报，在发表时给大家看了。”&nbsp;凯蒂突然站了起来。“我告诉你有关&nbsp;‘健康及科学’&nbsp;的书架在哪儿。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What does poison ivy look like?" asked Olivia. "What do ticks look like?"<br>
            "Let’s find some pictures," said Katie. "Then you can make cool posters to show during your report." Katie jumped up. "I’ll show you the health and science shelves."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢你，凯蒂。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。<br>
            很快，两个女孩儿就坐在了地板上，周围摆满了书。“哦！”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“这有一只又大又胖的蜱虫！它在咬那只狗！看到这个，我觉得肚子好饿！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thank you, Katie!" said Olivia. <br>
            Soon the girls were sitting on the floor, surrounded by books. "Ooh!" said Katie. "Here’s a big fat tick! He’s making a snack out of that dog! Seeing this, I’m feeling hungry."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好恶心啊！”&nbsp;奥利维亚笑了，“啊，我有花生酱三明治，我们一起吃吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            “谢谢。”&nbsp;凯蒂笑着回答奥利维亚。“她真好。”&nbsp;凯蒂想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Gross!" Olivia laughed. "Hey, I have a peanut butter sandwich. We could share it."<br>
            "Thanks," Katie answered, smiling at Olivia. "She’s really nice," thought Katie.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            突然，戴格斯特叔叔走了过来，低头看着她们。“凯蒂，乔伊刚才打电话来找你来着。她说你一个小时前就应该到家的。”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂睁大了眼睛。“啊，天啊！现在几点了？”&nbsp;凯蒂抬头看了看钟表。“呃啊！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道，“我得走了，现在马上！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Suddenly Mr. Dexter appeared, standing over them. "Katie, your sister just called looking for you. She said you should have been home over an hour ago."<br>
            Katie’s eyes went wide. "Oh no! What time is it?" Katie looked up at the clock. "Yikes!" she cried. "I have to go—right now!"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂拿起书包，跑出了图书馆。她跳上自行车，飞快地向家骑去。她把自行车扔在院子里，冲进了家里。<br>
            “我回来了！”&nbsp;她喊道。乔伊和爷爷坐在餐桌前。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie grabbed her book bag and ran out of the library. She hopped onto her bike and sped home as fast as she could. She dropped her bike in the yard and dashed inside.<br>
            "Here I am!" she called. Joy and Grandpa were sitting at the kitchen table.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “卢克和卡洛斯在哪儿？”&nbsp;凯蒂气喘吁吁地喊道。<br>

            “什么？可我已经找到了方块舞音乐。”&nbsp;凯蒂皱起了眉头。“乔伊，你手里拿的是什么？还有为什么你用它指着我？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where are Luke and Carlos?" cried Katie breathlessly. <br>
            "They left," said Joy. <br>
            "What! But I found square-dance music." Katie frowned. "Joy, what is that thing in your hand, and why are you pointing it at me?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是友谊测定仪。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“是我发明的。现在它指着哭脸，因为你让朋友失望了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “可是，我不是故意的。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “我知道。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“可是，好朋友会打电话解释发生了什么事。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "This is the friendship meter," answered Joy. "I invented it. Right now it is frowning because you let your friends down."<br>
            "But I didn’t do it on purpose," said Katie.<br>
            "I know," said Joy. "But a good friend would call and explain what happened."

            凯蒂不愿意。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie groaned. <br>
            "Joy is right," Grandpa said. "You should call Luke and Carlos now." <br>
            Katie went to the kitchen phone and dialed Luke’s number. "It’s ringing," she said.<br>

            "Hello, Luke? It’s Katie. I—I can explain—I know—I was working at the library with Olivia and—What? I never said I didn’t like her! Anyway—Luke? Hello?"

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂跺了一下脚。“他挂了我的电话！气死我了！”&nbsp;她又拨了一次卢克的号码。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie stomped her foot. "He hung up on me! That makes me so mad!" She dialed Luke’s number again.<br>

            乔伊叹了口气，“我听说朋友关系对健康很重要，你应该想办法和朋友们和好。”&nbsp;她说。<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy sighed. "I’ve learned that friends are very important for your health. You could use some tips about how to make up with them," she said.<br>

            星期一早上，在学校，凯蒂很生气。可是，她也很担心。如果她不和卢克、卡洛斯和好，她的方块舞计划就完了。她递给乔伊一张纸条，<br>
            “帮我把这个传给卡洛斯。”&nbsp;她说。她递给奥利维亚一张纸条，“帮我把这个传给卢克。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            At school on Monday morning, Katie was mad, but she was also worried. If she didn’t make up with Luke and Carlos, her square-dance plans were finished. She handed a note to Joy. <br>
            "Please pass this to Carlos," she said. She gave a note to Olivia. "Please pass this to Luke."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            两张纸条写着同样的话：“今天晚上过来练舞！”&nbsp;<br>
            “B-ù&nbsp;是&nbsp;‘不’！”&nbsp;卡洛斯写道。<br>
            “不可能。”&nbsp;卢克写道。<br>
            “该劳拉发表了，主题是关于眼睛的。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说。<br>
            劳拉拿着一个粉色的手提箱走到教室前面。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The notes said the same thing: Come to dance practice tonight!<br>
            N-O is NO, wrote Carlos.<br>
            NO WAY, wrote Luke.<br>
            "It’s time for Laura’s report on eyes," said Teacher Barrow.<br>
            Laura carried a small pink suitcase to the front of the room.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“大家好。我很担心大家的眼睛！”&nbsp;她说，“你们一定要保护眼睛！”&nbsp;她的眼睛睁得很大。“像剪刀这样锋利的东西一定要小心。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊想起了曾经凯蒂拿着剪刀从楼上跑下来的情景。她踢了一下凯蒂的书桌，让她好好儿听。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Everyone, I’m worried about your eyes!" she said. "You must protect them!" Her eyes got big behind her glasses. "Watch out for sharp things—like scissors!"<br>
            Joy remembered when Katie ran down the steps with scissors. She kicked Katie’s desk to make sure she was listening.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            劳拉继续说：“像飞镖这样的东西也一定要小心。还有像爆竹这样的物品，油漆清除剂这种液体也要小心。”&nbsp;劳拉把手放进了她的手提箱。<br>
            “这是安全镜。”&nbsp;她说，“它可以戴在普通眼镜上。当你做科学实验或使用工具时，请戴上它。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Laura continued. "Watch out for flying things—like darts. And you should also be careful of things like firecrackers and liquids like paint remover!" Laura reached inside her suitcase. <br>
            "These are safety glasses," she said. "They are worn over regular glasses. Wear them when you do science experiments or use tools."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            劳拉拿出更多的眼镜。“这是很酷的运动眼镜，我打垒球时会戴它。还有太阳镜，保护眼睛不受阳光的伤害。<br>
            如果你看不清书本或黑板，请告诉你的父母。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Laura pulled out more glasses. "These are very cool sports glasses that I wear when I play softball. And these sunglasses protect my eyes from harmful sunrays. <br>
            "If you have trouble seeing your books or the board, tell your parents.

            你可能需要一副眼镜了。我一直戴着眼镜。如果我摘下眼镜，看着就会很奇怪。你们看！我看着像另一个人似的！”&nbsp;<br>
            劳拉关上她的手提箱。“谢谢。”&nbsp;说完，她回到了她的座位上。<br>
            “真不错！”&nbsp;乔伊对她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Maybe you need glasses. I wear glasses all the time. If I take them off, I look weird! Look! I look like someone else!"<br>
            Laura closed her suitcase. "Thank you," she said and returned to her desk.<br>
            "That was great!" Joy told her.<br>

    </div>
    <div>

            下一个是乔伊发表。“我要介绍一下怎么建立友谊。首先，在我发表时，希望大家能做一个友好的听众。请把身体转向我，看着我的眼睛。”&nbsp;乔伊看了看大家。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Next was Joy’s presentation. "I’m going to talk about how to build friendships. First, I want you all to be friendly listeners during my report. Please turn your bodies toward me and look into my eyes." Joy looked at everyone.

            “如果一个人看起来很亲切，请说一些友好的话，那就是建立新友谊的办法。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Good. Now, please pay attention while I’m presenting!" She smiled. "Is everybody ready?"<br>
            Everyone nodded at Joy.<br>
            "If you see someone who looks like a nice person, say something friendly. That’s how to start a new friendship.<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            你可以主动帮忙拿东西。或者，你也可以让他帮助你！”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂点了点头。她想起了在图书馆里奥利维亚向她寻求帮助的场景。她转头向她的新朋友微笑。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You could offer to help carry things. Or you can ask someone to help you!" <br>
            Katie nodded. She remembered how Olivia had asked for help at the library. She turned and smiled at her new friend.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“你也可以夸一个人头发好看或运动鞋很可爱。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“在开学第一天，劳拉告诉奥利维亚她的夏威夷果项链很酷。那就是一句很友好的话。”&nbsp;乔伊深吸了一口气，向劳拉笑了笑，继续说着。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You can also say someone has a nice haircut or cute sneakers," said Joy. "On the first day of school, Laura told Olivia that her kukui nut necklace was cool. That was a friendly thing to say." Joy took a breath, smiled at Laura, and continued.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Here are some other ways to be a good friend," she said. "Be kind. Don’t make fun of your friends."<br>

            "Be a dependable friend. Don’t back out on promises or plans."<br>

            On Tuesday morning, Luke and Carlos stood outside their fourth-grade classroom. <br>
            "I’ve been thinking," said Carlos. "If we make up with Katie now, she’ll make us square-dance."

            卢克挑起眉毛。“等她发表完，我们再和她和好怎么样？”&nbsp;<br>
            “没错。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。<br>
            “呃哦！”&nbsp;卢克说，“她过来了。”&nbsp;凯蒂沿着走廊大步走来。乔伊拿着友谊测定仪跟在后面。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Luke raised his eyebrows. "Maybe we should make up after she does her presentation?" <br>
            "Yeah," said Carlos. <br>
            "Uh-oh," said Luke. "Here she comes." Katie walked down the hall taking big steps. Joy and the friendship meter were right behind her.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “朋友们！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Friends!" called Katie. <br>
            Luke groaned. "We’re caught. Like rats in a trap." <br>
            "I’ve come to say I’m sorry," Katie announced. She glanced at Joy, who nodded. "Sorry I missed practice. I should have watched the time."

            “卢克？”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            卢克叹了口气。“我不该挂你的电话。”&nbsp;<br>

            “还不错，”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“我觉得好多了！”&nbsp;<br>

            The pointer was on the smiling face. "That’s good enough," she said. "I think you’ve made up now." <br>
            Luke and Carlos didn’t say anything. They just rushed into class.<br>
            "That wasn’t so bad," said Katie. "And I feel a lot better!"<br>

            那天下午，奥利维亚也发表了。她拿着一张海报，上面有个太阳。<br>
            “大家觉得被太阳晒黑的皮肤很好看。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“但过度的晒太阳会引起灼伤，甚至会导致皮肤癌。所以，请使用防晒霜。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            That afternoon, Olivia presented. She held up a poster with a big yellow sun.<br>
            "You may think a tan looks good," she said. "But too much sun can cause burns—and skin cancer later. So use sunscreen."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            奥利维亚拿起另一张海报。“在夏威夷，有一种虫子叫蜈蚣。它们能长到三十厘米，还会刺人。这只黑虫子不是蜈蚣，是蜱虫。”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂咧嘴笑了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Olivia held up another poster. "In Hawaii they have bugs called centipedes. They can grow to be thirty centimeters long, and they sting. This black bug isn’t a centipede. It’s a tick." <br>
            Katie smiled.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“如果你路过一片高草地，”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“进屋时，请确认有没有蜱虫。”&nbsp;<br>
            奥利维亚拿起最后一张海报。“毒藤。”&nbsp;她说，“如果你看见这样的植物，有三片叶子，请离它远点儿。如果你碰了它，请马上用肥皂和水洗一洗。不要等，不然就晚了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "If you’ve been walking in tall grass," said Olivia, "check for ticks when you go inside." <br>
            Olivia held up her last poster. "Poison ivy," she said. "If you see a plant like this—with three leaves—stay far away. If you touch it, rush inside and wash with soap and water. Don’t wait or it might be too late!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，奥利维亚递给大家一瓶护手霜。“护手霜能保护你的皮肤。这是用夏威夷果做的，就像我的项链一样！大家试一试吧！”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的发表非常好。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then Olivia passed around a jar of hand cream. "Cream can protect your skin. This one is made from kukui nuts. Just like my necklace! Go ahead and try some."<br>
            "Very nice report," said Teacher Barrow.

            下一个是卡洛斯。<br>

            “我们听不见你的声音！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Carlos was next. <br>
            "If you didn’t have ears," said Carlos, "you couldn’t hear sirens, trains, or even tornadoes."<br>

            “所以，你必须保护好耳朵。”&nbsp;卡洛斯看着他的纸条，“声音过大会伤害你的耳朵。如果别人能听见你耳机里的声音，那说明音乐声太大了。”&nbsp;卡洛斯又看了一眼他的纸条。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "So you must protect your ears." Carlos looked at his notes. "Loud sounds can harm your ears. If other people can hear music from your earphones, the music is too loud." Carlos looked at his notes.

            “不要把尖锐的东西放进耳朵里。事实上，不要把任何东西放进耳朵里。我说完了。”&nbsp;说完，他回到了座位上。<br>
            “你的发表很棒。”&nbsp;凯蒂小声说，“简单明了。”&nbsp;<br>
            卢克的&nbsp;“健康饮食”&nbsp;是今天最后一个发表，他在发零食！

            "Don’t put anything pointy in your ears. In fact, don’t put anything in your ears. That’s all," he said and returned to his desk.<br>
            "Good report," whispered Katie. "Simple and clear."<br>
            Luke’s "Healthy Eating" was the last presentation of the day. He was serving snacks!<br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “食物就好像是身体的燃料！”&nbsp;卢克说，“没有食物，我们就不能跑。”&nbsp;他打开一张大海报，把它固定到了白板上。<br>
            “这是一个食物金字塔。这些零食是我妈妈准备的，包括了这个金字塔里所有的食物群。水果、蔬菜、谷类，乳制品和坚果！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Food is like gasoline for our bodies!" said Luke. "We can’t run without it." He unrolled a big poster and pinned it to the whiteboard.<br>
            "This is a food pyramid. And these are snacks prepared by my mom at Fried Pie Heaven. They include all the food groups in the pyramid. Fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and nuts!"<br>

            “什么？”&nbsp;同学们喊道。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Where are the crispy pies?" asked Larry. <br>

            "What?" cried the students.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “脆皮派里的脂肪和糖太多了，我们不应该经常吃。因此，妈妈总会在菜单上加上很多健康的食物。”&nbsp;<br>
            “吃吧！”&nbsp;卢克说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They have too much fat and sugar. We shouldn’t eat them very often. That’s why my mom makes sure there are healthy foods on the menu too."  <br>

            While the students ate, Katie sneaked up behind Luke and Carlos. <br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When Katie came into the classroom, everyone turned and stared. She was wearing Western boots, jeans, and a cowgirl hat. She had tied a scarf around her neck. <br>

            Katie turned to Joy. "Get out the friendship meter," she said. "Someone is teasing."<br>

            After lunch Ms. Barrow told Katie it was time for her presentation. <br>
            "Finally it's my turn!" she thought, walking to the front of the room. "Hello, everyone." Then she asked the kids to call out exercises they liked. "You shout them out. I’ll write them on the board."<br>

            Today was the Willow Creek Harvest Fair. The whole Donovan family was helping Grandpa sell crops from his garden.

            “我要三个苹果。”&nbsp;邮递员杰夫说。

            Carrots, onions, sweet potatoes, apples, cucumbers, and radishes covered Grandpa’s table. A dozen fat pumpkins sat on the ground.<br>
            "Could someone carry a pumpkin to my car?" asked Mrs. Pinker.<br>
            "I’d like three apples," said Jeff the mailman.

            “凯蒂，你快去把她叫回来！”&nbsp;妈妈说。<br>

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Katie, quickly go and get her," said Mom. <br>
            Katie ran through the crowd in the town park. She found her sister shaking her body to the beat of the country music.<br>
            "Joy!" called Katie. "Mom said to come back and help!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊没注意到凯蒂。当乐队演奏结束时，乔伊和人群一起鼓掌欢呼。这时，一个穿着牛仔背带裤的女孩儿走上了舞台。她拿着一把小提琴。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy was not paying attention to her sister. When the band played their final notes, she clapped and cheered with the crowd. Then a girl in jean overalls ran onto the stage. She was carrying a violin.

    </div>
    <div>

            “让我们欢迎这个来自柯比维尔的小提琴手——玛吉·道威尔！”&nbsp;主持人喊道。<br>
            “你看！她跟我们一样大。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            凯蒂看见玛吉拿起她的小提琴开始演奏民谣。刚开始，她演奏的音乐缓慢而悠扬。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let’s all welcome this little violinist from Kirbyville—Maggie Dowell!" shouted the announcer. <br>
            "Look! She’s our age," Joy said. <br>
            Katie watched as Maggie Dowell lifted her violin and started playing an old folk song. At first the music she played was slow and  harmonious.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “告诉妈妈我马上就回去。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我想再听一曲。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好吧！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。可是，她也没动。玛吉的小提琴演奏越来越生动。她跟着节奏跺着右脚。她的琴弓划过琴弦，&nbsp;在空中扬起了灰尘。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Tell Mom I’ll be right there," said Joy. "I want to hear one more song." <br>
            "Okay," said Katie, but she didn’t move either. Maggie’s violin playing was getting livelier. She stomped her right foot to the beat. Her bow went across the strings, sending dust into the air.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “真希望我也能像她那样拉小提琴！”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>

            "I wish I could play the violin like that!" said Joy.<br>

            那天下午晚些时候，多诺万一家人坐在野餐桌前吃炸鱼和玉米棒。“沙莉姨妈和卢克来了！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “拉里的爸爸刚才在&nbsp;‘巨大南瓜大赛’&nbsp;上得了第一名！”&nbsp;卢克说，“他的南瓜有100多磅重！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Later that afternoon, the Donovans sat at a picnic table eating fried fish and corn on the cob. "Here comes Aunt Sally and Luke!" said Katie. <br>
            "Larry’s dad just won the giant pumpkin contest!" said Luke. "His pumpkin weighed more than one hundred pounds!"

            “还可以修理园子栅栏。”&nbsp;爸爸说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We sold every one of our pumpkins," said Katie.<br>
            "Did you meet your goal?" asked Aunt Sally.<br>
            "Yes, we did," said Grandpa. "We made enough to buy seeds for next year."<br>
            "And to get the garden fence repaired," said Dad.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊对南瓜和种子不感兴趣。她只想聊一件事情——玛吉的小提琴演奏。“你们应该听听那个女孩儿的演奏！”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            “是的！她很棒！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。她跳起来，开心地演奏着想象中的小提琴。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy wasn’t interested in pumpkins or seeds. She could talk about only one thing—Maggie Dowell’s violin playing. "You should have heard that girl!" she said. <br>
            "Yeah! She was great!" said Katie. She jumped up and wildly played an imaginary violin.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            然后，她又一下子坐下，拿起玉米棒吃了起来。“不过，有谁会想每天都一直练习呢？”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then she plopped back down and picked up her corn on the cob. "But who wants to practice all the time?" <br>
            "I wouldn’t mind practicing," said Joy. "I’d do anything to play like Maggie Dowell."

            “你们曾祖母在比你们还小的时候，得到了她的第一把小提琴。”&nbsp;爷爷说，“她的爸爸甚至到贝兹市给她买了一把一半大小的小提琴，那是德国制造的。”&nbsp;<br>
            “如果你们俩见过曾祖母就好了。”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            “我真想听听她的演奏。”&nbsp;乔伊说。

            "When your great-grandma was younger than you,  she got her first violin," said Grandpa. "Her daddy went all the way to Bates City and bought her a half-size one. It was made in Germany."<br>

            Grandpa and Joy looked for the violin in the attic. They looked in the storage closet. <br>

            Then Joy raised the lid on the chest at the end of the hall. Grandpa took out an old photo album and pulled out two faded quilts. <br>

            Grandpa raised the black case from the chest and opened the lid.

            “哦！”&nbsp;乔伊说。她摸着小提琴的老木头和断掉的琴弦。“可怜的小提琴。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “这把小提琴演奏了很多音乐。”&nbsp;爷爷说。爷爷拿起一小块木头。“琴桥弯了。”&nbsp;爷爷说。他拿出了琴弓。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh!" said Joy. She touched the worn wood and broken strings of the violin. "Poor violin," she said.<br>
            "This violin has played a lot of music," said Grandpa. He picked up a small wooden piece. "The bridge is bent," he said. He took out the bow.

            "I think that this old violin is happy to see the light of day," he said. "It just needs a few repairs. While you are at school tomorrow, I’ll take it to the music shop in Bates City. I’ll find out about getting it fixed and ready to play again!"

            "For you and Joy," said Mom.

            凯蒂撕开信封。“哦！这是什么？”&nbsp;她拿着一张封面带有秋叶的卡片。<br>
            “邀请函！”&nbsp;她念道。她打开了卡片。<br>
            “坐干草车。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“阿杰生日那天会坐干草车，他邀请了我们。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie ripped open the envelope. "Hey! What’s this?" She held a card with autumn leaves on the front. "You’re invited," she read. She opened the card. <br>
            "A hayride," she said. "AJ is having a birthday hayride, and we’re invited."

            就在这时，乔伊和爷爷从后门走了进来。

            Katie checked the calendar on the kitchen wall. "It’s two weeks away. I’ll tell Joy."<br>

            Just then Joy and Grandpa came through the back door.

            “你猜怎么了！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。可是，当她看见乔伊的脸时，她停住了。“你怎么了？”&nbsp;<br>

            “那把小提琴需要修理的地方很多，超出了我们的预想。”&nbsp;爷爷说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Guess what!" said Katie. But she stopped when she saw Joy’s face. "What’s wrong?" <br>
            "Joy has some bad news," Mom said to Katie. <br>
            "The violin needs more repair than we thought," said Grandpa.<br>

            “我们现在修不起小提琴，”&nbsp;乔伊说。她看着妈妈。“得等一等。”&nbsp;

            "We can’t afford to get the violin fixed right now," said Joy. She looked at her mom. "I’ll just have to wait a while."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊深深地叹了一口气，关上了小提琴盒子。她拿起盒子上了楼。<br>
            没有人说话。突然，凯蒂想起了坐干草车的事情。“等等，乔伊！”&nbsp;她喊道，“我有个好消息！”&nbsp;她追着乔伊上了楼。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            With a big sigh, Joy closed the violin case. She picked the case up and went upstairs.<br>

            第二天，天气晴朗，阳光灿烂。四年级学生们去外面收集做美术作品时用的落叶。贝柔老师读了一个有趣的故事，说有一只懒大雁为了过冬飞往南方。乔伊几乎把坏小提琴的事情全忘了。下一节课是社会研究。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next day was bright and sunny. The fourth graders went outside and collected fallen leaves for an art project. Teacher Barrow read a fun story about a lazy goose flying south for the winter. Joy almost forgot about the broken violin. Then it was time for social studies.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “昨天，我们讲了目标。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“谁记得什么是目标？”&nbsp;<br>
            “目标是一个人想要的东西。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “也是一个人要努力实现的东西。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yesterday we talked about goals," said Teacher Barrow. "Who remembers what a goal is?"<br>

            “对。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“谁能举一个例子？”&nbsp;<br>

            “如果你想打好棒球，就得多练习。”&nbsp;拉里说。<br>
            “如果你想要的东西需要花很多钱呢？”&nbsp;乔伊问。

            "That’s right," said Teacher Barrow. "Who can give me an example?" <br>

            "If you want to be good at baseball, you practice a lot," said Larry. <br>
            "What if the thing you want costs money?" asked Joy.

            "For example, new shoes!" said Olivia.<br>

            “是的。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我想演奏曾祖母的小提琴。可是，琴弦断了，琴桥碎了，琴弓需要修理，全都需要钱。”&nbsp;<br>

            "Yes, I do," said Joy. "I want to play my great-grandma’s violin. But the strings and bridge are broken and the bow needs repair. All that costs money."  <br>

            "Think," repeated Joy.

            乔伊在科学课上一直想。回家的路上，她也一直想。<br>
            “有什么主意吗？”&nbsp;当她们把自行车停靠在车库边上时，凯蒂问。<br>
            “没有。”&nbsp;乔伊说。她踢走了一个核桃。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy thought during science class. On her way home, she kept thinking. <br>

            当全家人都坐下来吃晚饭时，乔伊还在想。今天晚上，他们在吃爷爷拿手的猪排。<br>

            Joy was still thinking when the family sat down for dinner. Tonight they were having Grandpa’s famous pork chops.<br>
            "Dad, did you forget to wash your hands?" said Katie. Dad looked down at his hands; they were black.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这是核桃污渍。”&nbsp;爸爸说，“它们洗不掉。我们上个星期在回收中心设立了核桃收购站。我今天忘了戴手套。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Walnut stains," he said. "They won’t wash off. We set up the walnut-buying station at the recycling center last week. I forgot to wear my gloves today."<br>

            "Busy!" said Dad. "Today Mr. Reiss brought a truck full of walnuts from his place. He said he has never had so many walnuts. We’re going to have a big harvest this year."<br>

            "Fifteen cents!" said Grandpa. He shook his head. "When I was a boy, we were paid five cents for a pound. One year, I wanted to buy an old bicycle. I had to collect a lot of walnuts."

            “每磅15&nbsp;美分&nbsp;？”&nbsp;<br>

            "For fifteen cents a pound?" <br>

            到了回收中心后，爸爸把手推车停到了脱壳机的旁边。双胞胎跳下了车。<br>
            “谁捡的这些核桃？”&nbsp;雷斯叔叔问道。<br>
            “乔伊和我。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“不过，它们是乔伊的核桃。”&nbsp;

            When they got to the recycling center, Dad parked the cart next to the shelling machine. The twins hopped out of the car.<br>
            "Who collected all these walnuts?" asked Mr. Reiss.<br>
            "Joy and I did," said Katie. "But they’re Joy’s walnuts."

            “我要用挣的钱去修曾祖母的小提琴。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            爸爸用铲子往脱壳机里放核桃，雷斯叔叔打开了机器开关。

            "I’m going to use the money I earn to fix my great-grandma’s violin," said Joy. <br>
            Dad used a shovel to put walnuts into the machine, and Mr. Reiss turned on the machine's switch.

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好吵啊！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道。两个女孩儿捂住耳朵，看着核桃被运了上去。然后，他们绕到机器另一边，看到核桃掉进了大袋子里。绿色外壳不见了。第一个袋子装满后，雷斯叔叔把另一个袋子放在了那里。第二个袋子装满了，第三个也装满了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It’s so noisy!" cried Katie. The girls covered their ears and watched the walnuts being lifted up. Then they went to the other side of the machine  and saw the walnuts shoot out and drop into a big bag. The green hulls were gone. When the first bag got full, Mr. Reiss put another bag in its place. The second bag filled up and then a third.

            第四个袋子差不多装满一半时，脱壳机安静了下来。<br>
            “就这些吗？”&nbsp;乔伊说，“一整手推车的核桃就装了四袋？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们称一下这些有多重。”&nbsp;雷斯叔叔说。他仔细看着秤上的数字。“一共170磅。每磅15美分。所以，一共是25.5美元。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            When the fourth bag was almost half full, the hulling went silent.<br>
            "That’s all?" said Joy. "The whole cart fits into four bags?" <br>
            "Let’s weigh them," said Mr. Reiss. He peered at the numbers on the scale. "That’s 170 pounds. So fifteen cents for each pound—that’s twenty-five dollars and fifty cents."

            “小心点儿。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。<br>
            “你会摔下来的。”&nbsp;乔伊说。

            "Katie, that is a bad idea," called Joy. <br>

            Katie pulled herself up higher and stepped onto the next branch. <br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “别摇了！”&nbsp;乔伊喊道。核桃像下雨一样从树上掉下来。麦古汪汪地叫了起来。奥利维亚和乔伊也尖叫起来。两个女孩儿跑着避开掉下来的核桃。<br>

            凯蒂从树干之间掉了下来，重重的摔到了地上。

            "Dad picked her up, and Mom drove them to the hospital," said Joy. <br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “没有，不过扭伤了脚踝。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“她几乎从脚趾到膝盖都缠满了绷带。她得冰敷脚踝。”&nbsp;<br>

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "No, she twisted her ankle," said Joy. "She has a bandage from her toes almost to her knee. And she has to put ice on her ankle." <br>
            "And she doesn’t have to come to school for at least two days," said Olivia. She looked at Teacher Barrow. "I mean she doesn’t get to come to school. She has to rest."

            “昨天你们的核桃把手推车装满了吗？”&nbsp;贝柔老师问乔伊。<br>
            “是的，装满了。然后，爸爸和我把它们拿到了核桃收购站。我们得在价格下降以前拿过去！”&nbsp;乔伊告诉大家核桃的价格会从15美分降到13美分。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Did you fill up your cart with walnuts yesterday?" Teacher Barrow asked Joy.<br>
            "Yes, I did. Then Dad and I took them to the walnut-buying station. We had to—before the price dropped!" Then Joy explained about the price falling from fifteen cents to thirteen cents.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我刚算好我的金钱目标，核桃价格就变了。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“真是太不公平了。”&nbsp;她叹了口气。“&nbsp;核桃收购站的雷斯叔叔......”&nbsp;<br>
            “他是我爸爸。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Just when I had my money goal all figured out, the price changed," said Joy. "That doesn’t seem fair." She sighed. "Mr. Reiss at the walnut-buying station—"<br>
            "That’s my dad," said Carlos.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊继续说道：“雷斯叔叔说价格下降是因为今年核桃太多了。可是，我还是不明白。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我来解释一下。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“你看，就像卡洛斯爸爸说的那样，今年的核桃非常多。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy continued. "Mr. Reiss said the price dropped because there are so many walnuts this year. But I still don’t understand it."<br>
            "I’ll try to explain," said Ms. Barrow. "You see, as Carlos’s father said, there are a lot of walnuts this year.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            因此，核桃公司就会收购到足够的核桃。可是，核桃多得超过了人们的需求。包括车、房子，任何东西只要供大于求，就会导致价格下降。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And the walnut company knows there are plenty of nuts to keep their plant operating. But there are more walnuts than people want.  When the supply of anything, incuding houses or cars, is greater than the demand, this causes the price to go down."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊想了一会儿。“核桃数量很少的时候，收购价格会高一些吗？”&nbsp;她问。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“因为收购价格高，所以人们会更努力的捡核桃。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的目标快实现了吗？”&nbsp;拉里问乔伊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy thought for a moment. "When there aren’t so many walnuts, will the buying price go up?" she asked.<br>
            "Yes," said Teacher Barrow. "Because the buying price became higher, people will work harder to collect walnuts." <br>
            "Are you close to reaching your goal?" Larry asked Joy.

            Joy opened her little notebook. "On Saturday, I made twenty-five dollars and fifty cents. On Sunday, I made twenty-four dollars and forty-five cents." <br>
            "How much more does Joy need to reach her goal of one hundred dollars?" asked Teacher Barrow.

            那天放学后，奥利维亚去看了凯蒂。她面朝着凯蒂，坐在乔伊的床上。“看见我的绷带了吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“还有我的冰袋！我得一直抬着这条腿。所以，我得把腿放在这个枕头上。”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            After school that day, Olivia visited Katie. She sat on Joy’s bed, across from Katie. "See my bandage?" said Katie. "And my ice pack? I have to keep my ankle elevated. That means I have to prop it up on these pillows."

            “疼吗？”&nbsp;奥利维亚问。<br>

            “那&nbsp;‘坐干草车’&nbsp;的活动怎么办呢？”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“你能去吗？”&nbsp;

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Does it hurt?" asked Olivia.<br>

            “星期一。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。

            星期六，当奥利维亚到的时候，凯蒂正坐在门廊的台阶上。她在活动她的脚。<br>
            “你在干什么？”&nbsp;奥利维亚问。<br>
            “你看这个，我写的是什么？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。奥利维亚仔细地看着凯蒂的脚。

            When Olivia arrived on Saturday, Katie was sitting on the porch steps. She was moving her foot.          <br>
            "What are you doing?" asked Olivia. <br>
            "Check this out. What does this spell?" said Katie. Olivia watched Katie's foot closely.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我写的是字母&nbsp;‘A’。”&nbsp;凯蒂解释说，“这是&nbsp;‘B’。你好好儿看看。”&nbsp;她又动了几下腿。“医生说我每天都得写几次字母。这样的话，我的脚踝就会变得很强壮。然后，我星期五就能去坐干草车了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I wrote the letter 'A'," explained Katie. "This is B. Watch carefully." She moved her foot around some more. "The doctor says I have to write the alphabet several times each day. If I do, my ankle will get strong. Then I can go to the hayride on Friday."

    <div>

            “太好了！”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“你继续写。我去捡核桃。”&nbsp;<br>
            “别被蜱虫咬了！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。奥利维亚笑了。<br>
            吃完早饭，乔伊就一直在捡核桃。她一看见奥利维亚向山坡上跑来，就马上跑去迎接她。<br>
            “我来了！我来帮你了！”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Great!" said Olivia. "You keep writing. I’ll go pick up walnuts." <br>
            "Don’t let the ticks bite you!" said Katie. Olivia laughed.<br>
            Joy had been collecting walnuts since after breakfast. When she saw Olivia jogging up the hill, she ran to meet her.<br>
            "Here I am! Ready to help!" said Olivia.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢你！”&nbsp;乔伊把奥利维亚带到手推车附近。“这些树下有非常多的核桃。”&nbsp;她说，“你看，我已经捡了好多了！爸爸说等装满了这车，我们就能去核桃收购站了。&nbsp;然后，我们还可以再捡一车！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thank you!" Joy pulled her over to the cart. "There are a million walnuts under these trees," she said. "Look how many I’ve collected! Dad says when the cart’s full, we can go to the walnut-buying station. Then we can fill it up again!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们来比一比，看谁能先装满自己的桶！”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。她一次捡起了两个核桃。&nbsp;几分钟的时间里，只能听见核桃&nbsp;“咚咚咚”&nbsp;地被扔进桶里的声音。<br>
            “满了！”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我赢了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let’s compare who can fill their bucket first!" said Olivia. She picked up two walnuts at once. For several minutes, the only sound was the thud, thud, thud of walnuts dropping into buckets.<br>
            "Done!" said Joy. "I win!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们再比一次！”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。她们把桶里的核桃倒进了手推车，然后继续捡起来。&nbsp;咚！咚！咚！<br>
            “满了！”&nbsp;奥利维亚喊道，“我们打平了！”&nbsp;女孩儿们笑了起来。虽然她们是在劳动，但却很有意思。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let’s do it again!" said Olivia. They emptied their buckets into the cart and started grabbing more walnuts. Thud, thud, thud. <br>
            "All filled!" cried Olivia. "It’s a tie!" The girls laughed. They were working, but it was fun!<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            太阳越升越高，乔伊沿路捡核桃捡到了树林附近。奥利维亚捡了一桶又一桶，一直捡到了池塘附近。<br>
            “那边的草好像又长高了许多。”&nbsp;乔伊喊道。<br>
            “这里是个好地方。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说，“很多核桃滚到了这里。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            As the morning sun rose higher, Joy moved closer to the woods. Olivia worked her way toward the pond, filling bucket after bucket.<br>
            "The grass seems to have grown taller there," Joy called.<br>
            "It’s a good spot," said Olivia. "Lots of walnuts have rolled down here."

            “你知道的，像毒藤和蜱虫什么的。总之，一定要小心。”&nbsp;<br>
            奥利维亚以最快的速度捡起核桃来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Just watch out," said Joy.<br>
            "Watch out for what?" said Olivia. <br>
            "You know, poison ivy and ticks. Be careful." <br>
            Olivia was picking up walnuts as fast as she could.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她很快就捡了满满一桶的核桃。“我要创造一个新的世界纪录了！”&nbsp;她大笑着说。突然，她尖叫了一声。<br>
            “蛇！”&nbsp;她喊道。她试着站起来，可却向后滑倒在草地上。她又尖叫了一声。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            She filled her bucket quickly. "I’m going to set a new world record!" she said with a laugh. Then she screamed. <br>
            "A snake!" she yelled. She tried to stand up, but she slipped back down into the grass. She screamed again.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “那只是一条黑蛇。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“你看！它走了。你吓到它了！”&nbsp;<br>
            “我吓到蛇了？”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。她向乔伊跑了过去。就在这时，一阵风刮了过来，吹动了树枝。一个核桃掉到了奥利维亚的脚上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "It’s just a black snake," said Joy. "There it goes. See? You scared it."<br>
            "I scared the snake?" cried Olivia. She ran toward Joy. Just then a strong breeze blew, shaking the branches. A walnut fell on Olivia’s toe.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “啊！”&nbsp;她大叫着，抬头看了一下树。这时，一个核桃又恰巧掉到了她的鼻子上。<br>
            “啊！好疼！”&nbsp;她揉着鼻子，又尖叫了一声。“&nbsp;啊！我的鼻子出血了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Ouch!" she cried and looked up into the tree. A walnut fell right on her nose! <br>
            "Oh! That really hurt!" She rubbed her nose and screamed again. "My nose is bleeding!"<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，奥利维亚像凯蒂一样，坐在了门廊的台阶上。“捏住你的鼻子，十分钟后再松开。”&nbsp;爷爷说。<br>
            “今天不要再捡核桃了。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“连着弯几个小时腰可不行。”&nbsp;<br>
            “又一个捡核桃的受伤了。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            A little later, Olivia was sitting on the porch steps like Katie. "Keep holding your nose for ten minutes," said Grandpa. <br>
            "And no more walnut collecting today," Mom said. "You shouldn’t bend over for several hours."<br>
            "Another damaged walnut picker," said Katie.

            Joy was heading back out for more walnuts. Just then Dad drove back in his truck. Joy talked with him a little and then walked toward the pond. Dad went toward the family.

            爷爷摇了摇头。“她没时间了。”&nbsp;他说，“你觉得她还能实现自己的目标吗？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Bad news for Joy," he said. "This morning the walnut company lowered the price again—to ten cents." <br>
            "Oh, poor Joy!" said Mom. <br>
            Grandpa shook his head. "She’s running out of time," he said. "Do you think she can still reach her goal?"<br>

            新年后的一个星期一。&nbsp;科学课上，乔伊正在听贝柔老师讲天气。她递给凯蒂一张纸条，上面写道：要是雨停了就好了！凯蒂点头，叹了口气。柳树溪这几天一直在下雨。乔伊希望下的是雪！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            It was the Monday after New Year's Day. In science class, Joy was listening to Teacher Barrow talk about the weather. She passed a note to Katie that said: "No more rain!" Katie nodded and sighed. It had been raining in Willow Creek for days. Joy wished it would snow!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “请把科学书收起来。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说。该上社会研究课了。“谁知道一月份有什么节日？”&nbsp;<br>
            劳拉举起了手。“有&nbsp;‘马丁∙路德∙金纪念日’。”&nbsp;她说。<br>
            “对！谁知道马丁∙路德∙金做了什么？”&nbsp;贝柔老师问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Science books away, please," Teacher Barrow said. It was time for social studies. "Who knows what holiday is in January?"<br>
            Laura raised her hand. "Martin Luther King Jr. Day," she said. <br>
            "Right! What did Martin Luther King Jr. do?" Teacher Barrow asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “他提倡种族平等。”&nbsp;卡洛斯回答说，&nbsp;“黑人和白人可以去同样的学校，也可以住在同一个小区。”&nbsp;<br>
            “是的。为了自由，他做了演讲，还领导了游行。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He promoted racial equality," Carlos answered. "So black people and white people could go to the same schools and live in the same neighborhoods."<br>
            "Yes. So he gave speeches and led marches for freedom," said Teacher Barrow.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“他为了自己的信仰而奋斗！他也因此成为了美国历史上伟大的领袖之一。”&nbsp;<br>
            贝柔老师在白板上写下了&nbsp;“领袖”&nbsp;二字。“我们的下一个社会研究发表是关于美国领袖的。”&nbsp;她给每个人发了一张作业纸，上面写着：“是什么造就了领袖？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "He fought for something he believed in. That made him become one of the great leaders in American history." <br>
            Teacher Barrow wrote "LEADERS" on the board. "Our next social studies presentation is going to be about American leaders." She passed out a worksheet that said: "What Makes a Leader?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “大家选择一个著名的历史人物，说一说是什么让这个人成为了一个伟大的领袖。之后，希望你们能在接下来的一周里，像这个领袖一样生活。”&nbsp;<br>
            “这个发表一定会很有意思的。”&nbsp;乔伊想。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "You'll all choose one famous person from history and talk about  what made this person a great leader. After that, you will try to live like your leader for the next week." <br>
            "This presentation will be interesting," thought Joy.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我觉得选乔治·华盛顿不错。那我得戴一顶有三只角的可笑帽子吗？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。<br>
            贝柔老师笑了。“不是的，凯蒂。是希望你偶尔可以想一下，&nbsp;‘如果是乔治·华盛顿，他会怎么做’&nbsp;的意思。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I might choose George Washington. Does that mean I have to wear a funny hat with three corners?" Katie asked. <br>
            Teacher Barrow smiled. "No, Katie. But now and then, you can ask yourself, 'What would George Washington do if he were me?'"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我想写关于乔治·华盛顿的发表。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。<br>
            “是我先想到他的。”&nbsp;凯蒂翻了个白眼，“不过，好吧！我选亚伯拉罕·林肯好了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我要选马丁·路德·金。”&nbsp;卢克大声说。同学们开始大声地喊出许多著名领袖的名字。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I want to do my presentation on George Washington," Carlos said. <br>
            "I thought of him first." Katie rolled her eyes. "But okay. I choose Abraham Lincoln instead." <br>
            "I'm going to do Martin Luther King!" Luke announced. All the students began shouting out the names of many famous leaders.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊安静地坐在她的座位上思考着，她想为自己的发表选一个完美的领袖。<br>
            双胞胎姐妹俩放学回到家时，爷爷正在厨房里。他正从烤箱里拿出一盘巧克力饼干。“你们回来得正好。”&nbsp;他说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy sat quietly at her desk, thinking. She wanted to pick the perfect leader for her presentation.<br>
            When the twins got back home after school, they found Grandpa in the kitchen. He was lifting a tray of chocolate chip cookies out of the oven. "Just in time, girls," he said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “好香啊！谢谢爷爷。”&nbsp;凯蒂边说边坐在了桌旁。乔伊走向冰箱。&nbsp;她给自己和凯蒂各倒了一杯牛奶。<br>
            “爷爷，您最喜欢的美国领袖是谁？”&nbsp;乔伊问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "They smell good! Thanks, Grandpa," Katie said, plopping herself down at the table. Joy went to the refrigerator. She poured a glass of milk for herself and for Katie. <br>
            "Grandpa, who is your favorite American leader?" Joy asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嗯，应该是富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福总统。他帮我们国家走出了大萧条。人们失去了一切。如：工作、房子、甚至金钱。罗斯福总统找到办法帮了很多人。”&nbsp;爷爷回答，“怎么了？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hmm. Probably President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He helped our country out of the Great Depression. Many people had lost everything. Like their jobs, houses, and even their money. And Roosevelt found ways to help many of these people," Grandpa answered. "Why?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们学校在准备一个关于领袖的发表。”&nbsp;凯蒂边吃着饼干边说道，“我选了亚伯拉罕·林肯。尽管会被很多人憎恶，他还是勇敢的说他不喜欢奴隶制。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "We're doing a presentation on leaders at school," Katie said, her mouth full of cookie. "I chose Abraham Lincoln. Even though he was hated by many people, he was brave enough to say he didn't like slavery."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “还有，他在美国内战时，也非常努力地工作。”&nbsp;爷爷补充说，“对于你的发表来说，林肯是一个很棒的选择。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊皱起了眉头。她还是不知道该选哪个领袖。“哦！已经四点半了！”&nbsp;她抬头看了一眼墙上的钟表，说道，“我得去喂鸡，写作业，练小提琴了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And he worked very hard during America's Civil War," Grandpa added. "Lincoln is a great choice for your homework."<br>
            Joy frowned. She still didn't know which leader to choose. "Oh! It's already four thirty!" she cried, glancing up at the clock. "I have to take care of the chickens, do my homework, and practice my violin!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “还有，一会儿你得洗碗。”&nbsp;爷爷提醒她，“因为晚饭后，我和你爸爸要去钓鱼。”&nbsp;乔伊已经忘了，每年的这个时候，爷爷和爸爸都要去钓鱼。&nbsp;这意味着她和凯蒂这个星期会有更多的家务活。她从椅子上跳了起来。这个星期会很忙！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And wash the dishes later," Grandpa reminded her. "Because after dinner your dad and I are going fishing." Joy had forgotten that this time every year, Grandpa and Dad went fishing. That meant she and Katie would have more chores this week. She jumped up from her chair. It was going to be a busy week!

            第二天早上，凯蒂和乔伊坐在餐桌前。凯蒂皱着眉头，看着自己面前的碗。“我们得吃麦片吗？”&nbsp;她问妈妈。爷爷平时都是给他们做燕麦粥或者薄饼的。<br>
            “对不起，宝贝们。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“爷爷不在家，我得准备去上班。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The next morning Katie and Joy sat at the kitchen table. Katie frowned at the bowl in front of her. "We're having cereal?" she asked her mother. Grandpa usually made them oatmeal or pancakes.<br>
            "Sorry, girls," Mom said. "Grandpa's away, and I have to get ready to go to work."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊突然想到了一个好主意！“我去拿些鸡蛋做煎蛋卷！”&nbsp;她穿上雨衣，跑向鸡圈。“早上好，小鸡们！”&nbsp;她跟母鸡们打招呼。她一打开门，四只鸡就跑到她脚边咯咯地叫着。她把手伸向鸡窝，居然没有鸡蛋！好奇怪。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy had an idea. "I'll get some eggs to make us an omelet!" She put on her raincoat and ran out to the chicken coop. "Good morning, girls," she called to the hens. Four of them clucked around her ankles as she opened the gate. She reached her hand into the nest box. No eggs! That was strange.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“母鸡们太懒了。”&nbsp;乔伊回到厨房说，“今天没有鸡蛋！”&nbsp;<br>
            妈妈在洗碗槽洗碗，她抬起了头。“那是挺奇怪。不过，反正你们俩现在该去上学了，抓紧时间吃你们的麦片。还有，别忘了放学后来图书馆。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "The hens are lazy," Joy announced back in the kitchen. "No eggs today!" <br>
            Mom looked up from the sink, where she was washing dishes. "That's strange. But you girls have to leave for school soon anyway. Hurry up and eat your cereal.

            在课上，贝柔老师说今天要准备社会研究课的发表。“在接下来的半个小时里，请自己做作业。”&nbsp;贝柔老师说，“你可以上网或看书来查领袖的信息。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And don't forget to come to the library after school."   <br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊看了看四周。拉里拿出一本关于富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福总统的书。劳拉在读一本关于亚伯拉罕·林肯的书。好像大部分同学都去过公共图书馆了。大家都已经开始准备发表文了。可是，乔伊还没选好她的领袖！
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy looked around. Larry had pulled out a book about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Laura was reading a book on Abraham Lincoln. It seemed like most kids had already gone to the public library. They were ready to start their projects, but Joy hadn't even chosen her leader yet!

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Teacher Barrow saw her. "Here, Joy. Try this." Ms. Barrow handed her a book called 《Great American Biographies》. "You might find someone you want to write about in here."br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            可是，她无法集中注意力。她在想今天早上妈妈贴在冰箱上的家务清单，她在想自己带了什么午饭。然后，她开始想爷爷和爸爸去钓鱼时会做些什么。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            But she couldn't concentrate. She thought about the list of chores Mom had put on the refrigerator this morning. She thought about what she had brought for lunch. Then she started wondering what Dad and Grandpa were doing on their fishing trip.

            Katie jumped up from a computer and ran to Joy's desk. "Did you know that Abraham Lincoln used to walk miles just to borrow a book?" Katie whispered. Joy shook her head. "He loved to read and write," Katie added. Joy shrugged. "So I think we should walk to the library after school today! Get it? Like Abe Lincoln!"

            After school it was still raining. <br>

            晚饭后，乔伊练小提琴练到睡觉时间。然后，她拿起一个手电筒。“我要去看看鸡蛋！”&nbsp;她喊道。她走向外面的鸡圈。“一、二、三、四、五、六。”&nbsp;乔伊数了数鸡。“都在！”&nbsp;然后，她用手电筒照了一下鸡窝。还是没有鸡蛋！

            After dinner Joy practiced her violin until bedtime. Then she grabbed a flashlight. "I'm going to check for eggs!" she called. She headed outside toward the chicken coop.

            While Larry kept talking, Katie wrote a note to her sister. It said: "A house divided against itself cannot stand . . ." –Abraham Lincoln.<br>
            Another note followed. That means we have to stick together. Do not answer unless Mr. Curtis calls you by the right name!<br>

            “哎呀，”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“天要黑了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我们该回家了。”&nbsp;卡洛斯说。<br>
            “你们家有个池塘，可真好。”&nbsp;劳拉说。<br>
            凯蒂和乔伊把朋友们送到车道上，挥手说再见。然后，她们也回家了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Rats," said Katie. "It's getting dark." <br>
            "We'd better go home," said Carlos. <br>
            "You guys are so lucky to have a pond," Laura said. <br>
            Katie and Joy walked their friends to the driveway and waved good-bye. Then they headed inside.

            “等等。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“我要去捡鸡蛋，再看看母鸡们。”&nbsp;<br>
            她来到鸡圈，母鸡们并在一起睡觉，挤在一起取暖。“一、二、三、四、五。”&nbsp;乔伊数了数，“五只？还有一只不见了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wait," said Joy. "I'm going to collect eggs and check on the hens." <br>
            She walked over to the chicken coop. The hens were sleeping side-by-side, huddled together for warmth. "One, two, three, four, five," Joy counted. "Five? One is missing!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊又快速地数了一遍，还是只有五只。第六只母鸡在哪儿呢？她查看了整个鸡圈。有人偷走了吗？它怎么出去的呢？<br>
            乔伊低着头走进了厨房。“妈妈，凯蒂，我有一个坏消息。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Frantic, Joy counted again. There were only five. Where was the sixth hen? She looked all around the chicken coop. Had someone stolen it? How could it have gotten out? <br>
            Joy walked into the kitchen, her head hanging. "Mom, Katie," she said. "I have bad news."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “怎么了，宝贝？”&nbsp;妈妈转过头来问道。她正在做意大利面。<br>
            “一只鸡没了。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “怎么会没了呢？”&nbsp;凯蒂说。突然，她倒吸了一口冷气。“等等，你是说死了一只鸡？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What's the matter, honey?" Mom asked. She was making pasta. <br>
            "I lost a chicken," Joy said. <br>
            "How can you lose a chicken?" asked Katie. Then she gasped. "Wait, do you mean one is dead?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我不知道。不过今天早上鸡圈里有六只，现在只有五只了。”&nbsp;乔伊安静地说，“我是一个坏学生、一个坏领袖，也是一个坏养鸡人。爷爷肯定对我很失望。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I don't know. But this morning there were six. Now there are only five," Joy said quietly. "I'm a bad student, a bad leader, and a bad chicken keeper. Grandpa will be disappointed in me."

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我会帮你找的。”&nbsp;凯蒂用一只胳膊搂着乔伊说道。她看了一眼漆黑的窗外，“明天。”&nbsp;她补充说。<br>
            “我也会帮你的。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“再说，谁知道呢？也许母鸡会自己出来。”&nbsp;妈妈也搂住了乔伊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I'll help you look for it," Katie said, putting an arm around her sister. She glanced out the dark window. "Tomorrow," she added. <br>
            "I will too," Mom said. "And who knows? Maybe the hen will show up on its own." She put her arm around Joy too.

            多诺万家的三个女人站在窗前，注视着漆黑的窗外。外面的风很大，今晚显得格外的寒冷。<br>
            “为什么我去滑冰了而没有去查看母鸡呢？”&nbsp;乔伊自问。“哦，迷路的母鸡！不论你在哪里，我都希望你能平安，暖和。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The three Donovan girls stood by the window, stared out window into the dark. The wind was strong and it looked colder than ever. <br>
            "Why did I go ice skating instead of checking on the hens?" Joy asked herself. "Oh, lost hen, I hope you're warm and safe, wherever you are."<br>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            星期六早上，天一亮，乔伊就起来了，别人都还没起床。她悄悄地穿上衣服，蹑手蹑脚地走下了楼梯。昨天晚上，她写了一个任务清单。今天，她决心要完成上面的所有事。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            On Saturday morning Joy woke up at sunrise. No one else was awake yet. She quietly pulled on her clothes and tiptoed downstairs. Last night she had made a to-do list. Today she was determined to finish everything on it.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她走进了院子，靴子踩在结冰的草地上发出嘎吱的声音。“一、二、三、四、五。”&nbsp;乔伊数了数旁边的母鸡，还是少了一只。“可怜的母鸡。”&nbsp;她说。她发现小水盆冻上了，于是去找砸冰的棍子。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Her boots crunched on the icy grass as she walked into the yard. "One, two, three, four, five." Joy counted the hens that were waddling around nearby. One was still missing. "Poor hens," she said. She noticed that their water basin had frozen, so she went to look for a stick to break up the ice.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，乔伊在园子里发现了什么东西。“嘿！你在那儿干什么？”&nbsp;是那只不见了的母鸡！<br>
            乔伊跑过去把母鸡抱了起来。“你还活着，太好了！”&nbsp;她一边说，一边摸母鸡的头，“你知道，逃出去是很危险的。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Then Joy spotted something in the garden. "Hey! What are you doing over there?" It was the missing hen! <br>
            Joy ran over and scooped up the hen. "Good thing you're alive," she said, patting its head. "It's dangerous to escape, you know."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊把母鸡放回了鸡圈，可她还是有一个疑问。“你到底是怎么出去的？”&nbsp;她仔细地查看了围栏的四周，但什么都没有发现。这时，她听见凯蒂在叫她吃早饭。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy put the hen back in the coop, but she still had questions. "How in the world did you get out?" She circled the fence, looking for a hole, but didn't find anything. Soon she heard Katie calling her for breakfast.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            吃饭时，乔伊告诉妈妈和凯蒂她是怎么找到母鸡的。“现在我得弄明白它是怎么跑出去的，不过我得先写关于领袖的发表。妈妈&nbsp;，我可以用你的电脑吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “当然可以。”&nbsp;妈妈说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            While she ate, Joy told Mom and Katie about how she'd found the hen. "Now I have to figure out how it escaped. But first I'm going to work on my leader project. Can I borrow your computer, Mom?" <br>
            "Of course," Mom said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “对了！妈妈，我还需要你所有的化妆棉和鞋油。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            妈妈盯着凯蒂，“你到底要做什么？”&nbsp;她问。<br>
            “我要做一个亚伯拉罕·林肯的胡子。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“星期一发表时，我要戴着它。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Oh! Mom, I'll need all your cotton balls and some shoe polish," Katie announced. <br>
            Mom stared at Katie. "What on earth for?" she asked. <br>
            "I'm going to make an Abraham Lincoln beard," said Katie. "To wear for my presentation on Monday."<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            妈妈笑了，“我等不及想看了！”&nbsp;<br>
            早饭后，孩子们开始做作业。凯蒂坐在厨房地板上做她的胡子，乔伊坐在桌前，浏览网上关于领袖的内容。麦古坐在乔伊脚边，闻凯蒂的鞋油味儿。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Mom laughed. "I can't wait to see that!"<br>
            After breakfast the girls started their homework. Katie sat on the kitchen floor to make her beard. Joy sat at the table, reading about leaders on the internet. Magoo sat by Joy's feet, sniffing at Katie's shoe polish.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “嘿，凯蒂，你知道关于哈丽特·塔布曼的事情吗？”&nbsp;乔伊问。<br>
            凯蒂放下化妆棉。“不知道。我从来没听说过她。她是谁？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hey, Katie, what do you know about Harriet Tubman?" Joy asked. <br>
            Katie put down a cotton ball. "Nothing. I've never heard of her. Who is she?"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “美国奴隶制存在时，她也曾是一个奴隶。她非常聪明，为了自由，她逃了出来。她还帮助过其他奴隶逃跑。她冒着生命危险帮助他们向北一路逃到了宾夕法尼亚州和加拿大！”&nbsp;乔伊说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "She was a slave, back when there were slaves in America. She was really smart, and she escaped to be free. Then she helped other slaves escape too. She risked her life helping them travel north, all the way to Pennsylvania and Canada!" explained Joy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “她好勇敢啊！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“在内战期间，她甚至还为联邦军工作过。”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂笑了。“嘿！我很想知道她是否见过亚伯拉罕·林肯！”&nbsp;她把几个染了色的化妆棉贴到了下巴上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "She sounds brave!" Katie said. <br>
            "Right," Joy said. "She even worked for the Union army during the Civil War."<br>
            Katie smiled. "Hey! I wonder if she ever met Abraham Lincoln!" She held up a few dyed cotton balls to her chin.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “你好，哈丽特。”&nbsp;凯蒂尽量模仿亚伯拉罕·林肯的声音说，“你愿意为联邦军而战吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我不是军人，林肯总统阁下，我是间谍！”&nbsp;乔伊喊道。双胞胎哈哈大笑起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hello, Harriet," she said in her best Abraham Lincoln voice. "Would you like to fight for the Union army?" <br>
            "I'm not a soldier, President Lincoln; I'm a spy!" Joy cried. The girls burst out laughing.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            就在这时，电话响了。<br>
            “我来接！”&nbsp;凯蒂跳了起来。<br>
            “嗨，奥利维亚。”&nbsp;她说，“没有，我什么也没做。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊看了看被凯蒂弄得乱七八糟的地板。有时候，她会为凯蒂和自己有太多的不同而感到惊讶。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Just then the phone rang. <br>
            "I'll get it!" Katie jumped up. <br>
            "Hi, Olivia," she said. "No, I'm not doing anything." <br>
            Joy raised her eyebrows at Katie's mess on the floor. Sometimes it was amazing how different she and her sister were.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “是的，”&nbsp;凯蒂大声说，“当然了，我想练习滑冰旋转！”&nbsp;她挂断了电话，拍了拍乔伊的肩膀。“把你的书收起来，奥利维亚要过来，我们要去滑冰。”&nbsp;她说。“麦古，别吃！”&nbsp;凯蒂伸手从麦古嘴里掏出了化妆棉。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Yes," Katie said loudly. "Of course I want to practice ice skating turns!" She hung up the phone and tapped Joy's shoulder. "Put your books away. Olivia's coming over. We're going ice skating," she said. "Magoo, don't eat that!" Katie reached down and pulled a cotton ball from Magoo's mouth.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            乔伊看了一眼外面，她想和奥利维亚、凯蒂练习滑冰旋转，可任务清单上并没有这一项内容。而且，她好不容易才想到了一个要发表的人物。乔伊清了清嗓子，“我去不了，”&nbsp;她说，“我要写一篇关于哈丽特·塔布曼的发表！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Joy glanced outside. She wanted to practice ice skating turns with Olivia and Katie, but it wasn't on her to-do list. And she had finally thought of a person for her presentation. Joy cleared her throat. "I can't," she said. "I've got a presentation to write about Harriet Tubman!"

            “呃！外面好冷！”&nbsp;奥利维亚边说边走进了厨房，“准备好去滑冰了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “你猜猜谁不跟我们一起去？”&nbsp;凯蒂皱着眉头说。<br>
            奥利维亚看着双胞胎。“乔伊？为什么不去呢？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Brr! It's cold outside!" Olivia said as she walked into the kitchen. "Are you ready to skate?"<br>
            "Guess who's not going with us," Katie said, frowning.<br>
            Olivia looked at the twins. "Joy? Why not?"

            “你理解？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。<br>
            “嗯。你需要我们帮你吗？”&nbsp;奥利维亚问乔伊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I finally chose my leader, so I need to do my homework. Our presentations are in two days!" said Joy. <br>
            Olivia nodded. "I understand," she said. <br>
            "You do?" asked Katie. <br>
            "Yes. Want us to help you?" Olivia asked Joy.

            “我们？”&nbsp;凯蒂重复道。<br>
            乔伊没理凯蒂的话，对着朋友露出了微笑。“我自己能完成的。不过，你们可以帮我解开鸡圈的谜团。”&nbsp;乔伊认为如果是哈丽特·塔布曼的话，一定不会对需要帮助的鸡置之不理的。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Us?" Katie repeated. <br>
            Joy ignored her sister's comment and smiled at her friend. "I can do the leader project by myself. But I could use help solving the chicken mystery." Harriet Tubman, she thought, would never ignore her pet chickens when they needed help.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">

            “你们三个，想喝点热可可吗？”&nbsp;妈妈问。<br>
            “想，谢谢！”&nbsp;三个女孩儿一起回答说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Count me in," said Olivia.<br>

            "Would anyone like some hot cocoa?" Mom asked. <br>

            凯蒂叹了口气，“应该不会的。”&nbsp;她承认说，“乔伊，你需要我们做什么？”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Olivia turned to Katie. "Ms. Barrow told us we had to act like our leaders. Would Abraham Lincoln go skating, while his friend—no, his sister—needed help?" <br>
            Katie sighed. "Probably not," she admitted. "What do you need us to do, Joy?"

            乔伊想要哭，可她知道，一个领袖得有责任感。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            An hour later the girls came to the chicken coop. Joy counted the chickens again.<br>
            "Oh no!" She gasped. "Now four are missing!" <br>

            “需要一个人去找它们，”&nbsp;她说，“另一个人得弄清楚它们是怎么逃出去的，还有一个人得在这儿看着这两只，以防它们也跑了！”&nbsp;<br>

            "Someone needs to look for them," she said. "Someone else needs to find how they are getting out. And the third person needs to keep an eye on the two in here. So they don't escape too!" <br>

            "I'll check the coop for any holes," said Katie.

        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Great, let's get to work!" Joy broke the ice on the chickens' water basin, then she filled the hens' feeding trough.   <br>
            A few minutes later, Olivia called, "Hey! Over here! I found something." She was waving from underneath the tree house.

            双胞胎跑了过去。奥利维亚站在一堆落叶和干草旁边，那是爷爷收集的。自从他被消防队长批评后，他就没有烧过任何东西。<br>
            “好像有几只鸡一直把这里当成窝了。”&nbsp;奥利维亚指着草堆上的六个褐色鸡蛋说。

        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            The twins ran over. Olivia was standing near a pile of leaves and hay that Grandpa had gathered. Ever since the day he had trouble with the fire chief, he hadn't burned anything. <br>
            "It looks like some chickens have been using this as a nest." Olivia pointed to six brown eggs lying on top of the pile.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            它们的颜色几乎和落叶一样。<br>
            “哇啊。”&nbsp;乔伊说，“这就是最近鸡蛋很少的原因。”&nbsp;<br>
            “它们为什么那么做呢？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。<br>
            乔伊耸了耸肩，“我也不知道。也许它们出去只是想找个柔软的地方下蛋而已吧！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            They were almost the same color as the leaves.<br>
            "Wow," Joy said. "That's why there were so few eggs lately."<br>
            "Why did they do that?" Katie asked. <br>
            Joy shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe once they got out, they just looked for a soft place to lay their eggs."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “现在我们只需要找到母鸡们......”&nbsp;奥利维亚开始说话。<br>
            “我知道了！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊道，“我们到树屋去吧。那里会很容易发现它们的。”&nbsp;<br>
            她们迅速爬上了树屋。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Now if we can just find the hens . . . ," Olivia began. <br>
            "I know!" Katie cried. "Let's go in the tree house. It's a great lookout spot!"<br>
            The girls hurried up to the  tree house.<br>

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “凯蒂，你真是个天才！我看见它们了！”&nbsp;奥利维亚喊道。她指了指在小溪边的四只鸡。<br>
            “任务完成！”&nbsp;乔伊说。她们把所有的鸡都找到了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Katie, you're a genius! I see them!" Olivia cried. She pointed to four chickens by the creek. <br>
            "Mission accomplished," Joy said. They had found all the chickens.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “刚才我发现它们是怎么出去的了。”&nbsp;凯蒂补充说。她把手伸进了栅栏之间的一个缺口，“这个铁丝网已经不牢固了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “我去问问妈妈我能不能用爸爸的工具。”&nbsp;乔伊说。&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "And I think I just discovered how they're getting out," Katie added. She stuck her hand through a gap in the fence. "The chicken wire here isn't strong anymore."<br>
            "I'll ask Mom if I can use Dad's tools," Joy said.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “在爷爷回来以前，我要修好它！”&nbsp;<br>
            “时间还来得及。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说着抬头看了看，黑灰色的乌云正在从她们头上飘过去。“暴风好像要来了，天气好冷，感觉要下雪了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I can fix it before Grandpa gets back!"<br>
            "It will be just in time too," Olivia said, looking up, and dark gray clouds were floating over their heads. "It looks like it's about to storm. And it feels cold enough to snow!"

            乔伊正在修理鸡圈的铁丝网。“好了！”&nbsp;她满意地说。她锁上鸡圈门，朝房子走去。<br>
            突然，凉凉、湿湿的东西掉在了她的脸上。是雪！<br>
            “妈妈！凯蒂！下雪了！”&nbsp;乔伊边喊边跑进了厨房。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            An icy wind blew as Joy stapled the chicken wire back to the fence post. "Finished!" she said happily. She locked the henhouse door and headed toward the house. <br>
            Something cold and wet landed on her face. Snow! <br>
            "Mom! Katie! It's snowing!" Joy cried, running into the kitchen.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “终于下雪了。”&nbsp;凯蒂说。她和奥利维亚坐在桌前，正喝着第二杯热可可。<br>
            “我非常喜欢雪。”&nbsp;奥利维亚说。<br>
            乔伊过来搂住了她的朋友，“谢谢你能来。很感谢你帮了我。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Finally it's snowing," said Katie. She and Olivia were at the table drinking another cup of cocoa. <br>
            "I love snow," Olivia said. <br>
            Joy put an arm around her friend. "Thanks for coming over. I'm really glad you helped me."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这就是朋友的意义。”&nbsp;奥利维亚笑着说。<br>

            乔伊笑了，“别担心，我会写完的。我保证！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That's what friends are for," Olivia said with a smile. <br>
            "I helped too, by the way," Katie said, poking her sister. "Now hurry up and finish your homework. We need to play in the snow tomorrow!" <br>
            Joy laughed. "Don't worry. I'll get it done, I promise!"

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            奥利维亚看着窗外，她睁大了眼睛。“我要打电话叫我妈妈来接我，雪下得太大了。”&nbsp;<br>
            奥利维亚走后，双胞胎坐在客厅里。乔伊在写她的作业，凯蒂在翻看杂志。外面的一切都被白色的雪覆盖了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Olivia was looking out the window, her eyes growing big. "I should call my mom to pick me up. It's snowing hard!"<br>
            After Olivia left, the twins sat in the living room. Joy worked on her homework while Katie flipped through a magazine. Outside, everything was covered in white.

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            过了一会儿，凯蒂叹了口气。“我觉得好无聊。”&nbsp;<br>
            突然，电话响了。<br>
            “我来接！”&nbsp;凯蒂跑向电话。<br>
            在厨房里的妈妈看了看钟表，“应该是爸爸和爷爷，”&nbsp;她说，“他们很快就会回来了。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Soon Katie sighed. "I'm so bored."<br>
            Suddenly the phone rang. <br>
            "I'll get it!" Katie ran to the phone.<br>
            In the kitchen Mom looked at the clock. "It's probably Dad and Grandpa," she said. "They should be home soon."

    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “喂，爸爸！”&nbsp;凯蒂接起电话说，“这里的雪也下得很大......哦。”&nbsp;凯蒂的声音变低了，“哦，不，好吧......”&nbsp;凯蒂把电话递给了妈妈，“爸爸要跟您说话。”&nbsp;<br>
            妈妈接过电话后，凯蒂马上回去找乔伊。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Hi, Dad!" Katie said into the phone. "It's snowing really hard here too . . . Oh." Katie's voice dropped. "Oh no. Okay . . ." She held out the phone to Mom. "Dad needs to talk to you." <br>
            As Mom took the phone, Katie hurried back to Joy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “爸爸和爷爷被困住了。高速公路因为大雪封闭了！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            “哦，不，他们该怎么办呢？”&nbsp;乔伊问。<br>
            “他们说会去其他城市的旅馆。”&nbsp;妈妈说完，也坐到了孩子们边上。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Dad and Grandpa are stuck. The highway is closed because of snow!" Katie said. <br>
            "Oh no. What will they do?" Joy asked. <br>
            "They'll go to a hotel in another town," Mom said as she sat next to the girls.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “别担心，明天早上公路就会被打扫干净的。”&nbsp;妈妈补充说，“这意味着我们还能再在一起度过一个晚上。”&nbsp;<br>
            “只有女孩子们!&nbsp;”&nbsp;乔伊笑着对妈妈说。<br>
            “我们一边看电影一边吃爆米花！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Don't worry. The road will be plowed by morning," she added. "This means we have another night by ourselves." <br>
            "Just us girls!" Joy said, smiling at her mom. <br>
            "We should watch a movie and eat popcorn!" Katie said.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “一定会很有意思的！”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;妈妈说，“不过，你们俩都有作业要做，不是吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我没有。”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“我的发表写完了！”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊犹豫了一下，“我还有事情要做，可是......”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "That sounds fun!" said Joy.<br>
            "Yes," said Mom. "But you girls have homework to do, don't you?" <br>
            "Not me," Katie said. "I finished writing my presentation!" <br>
            Joy hesitated. "I still have work to do, but . . ."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            &nbsp;“现在换作是哈丽特·塔布曼，你觉得她会怎么做呢？”&nbsp;妈妈问。<br>
            这时，乔伊想起了一个有关哈丽特·塔布曼的故事。她为了自由逃跑时，一路从马里兰走到了宾夕法尼亚，那大概有两百公里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What do you think Harriet Tubman would do right now?" Mom asked.<br>
            Joy thought of a story she had read about Harriet Tubman. When Harriet escaped to freedom, she walked all the way from Maryland to Pennsylvania. That was about two hundred kilometers.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            她没有一句抱怨，一直不停地走，也没有放弃。<br>
            乔伊叹了口气。“好吧，妈妈，我继续写我的发表。”&nbsp;<br>
            “凯蒂，我们在厨房烤布朗尼，怎么样？”&nbsp;妈妈问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            And Harriet never complained; she kept walking and never gave up. <br>
            Joy sighed. "Okay, Mom. I'll keep writing my presentation." <br>
            "Katie, how about we bake brownies in the kitchen instead?" Mom asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂点了点头，跟着妈妈走出了客厅。<br>
            “我们得让乔伊一个人待着。”&nbsp;妈妈小声说，“那样，她才能完成她的作业。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好。”&nbsp;凯蒂也小声说。她尽量保持安静。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie nodded and followed her mom out of the living room. <br>
            "We need to leave Joy alone," Mom whispered. "So she can finish her homework." <br>
            "Okay," Katie whispered back. She could try to be quiet.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们看看能不能找到爷爷的布朗尼做法。”&nbsp;妈妈小声说。<br>
            一个小时过去了，乔伊还在客厅里写作业。她闻到了一股烧焦了的味道。<br>
            “看！”&nbsp;凯蒂喊了一声。她端来了一大盘布朗尼。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Let's see if we can find Grandpa's brownie recipe," Mom whispered.<br>
            An hour passed and Joy was still doing her homework in the living room. Soon she smelled something burning. <br>
            "Look!" Katie cried, marching in with a plate full of brownies.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “凯蒂，嘘！”&nbsp;妈妈提醒她。<br>
            “哎呀。”&nbsp;凯蒂咧嘴笑了。“看！”&nbsp;她小声说，“烤糊的布朗尼可以帮你集中注意力！”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊咯咯地笑了。她已经记不起来凯蒂上一次烤的是什么了。哦，不是！是记不起来凯蒂为她烤的是什么了。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Katie, shh!" Mom reminded her. <br>
            "Oops." Katie grinned. "Look," she whispered. "Burnt brownies to help you concentrate!"<br>
            Joy giggled. She couldn't remember the last time Katie had baked something. Or baked something for her.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “谢谢。”&nbsp;她说，“有你真好！”&nbsp;<br>
            凯蒂又向乔伊做了一个&nbsp;“双胞胎”&nbsp;的手势。妈妈把手放到了乔伊的肩膀上，“晚安，宝贝，别做得太晚了。”&nbsp;<br>
            “好的，妈妈。”&nbsp;乔伊说。她为了完成发表又写了起来。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Thanks," she said. "That was nice of you."<br>
            Katie gave Joy the sign for "twin" again. Mom put her hand on Joy's shoulder, and said, "Good night, honey. Don't stay up too late." <br>
            "All right, Mom," Joy said. She started writing again to finish her presentation.

            Joy gave her grandfather a huge hug. "When did you get back?"<br>

            "And isn't it nice that Grandpa is back to cook breakfast for us?" Katie replied. Mom laughed. <br>

            “真棒！”&nbsp;爷爷说。<br>
            “还有，我们明天终于要在学校发表了。”&nbsp;乔伊说。<br>
            “你最后选了谁？”&nbsp;爷爷问。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Wonderful!" said Grandpa. <br>
            "And tomorrow at school we're finally giving our reports on leaders," said Joy. <br>
            "Who did you end up choosing, Joy?" Grandpa asked.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “哈丽特·塔布曼，”&nbsp;乔伊说，“她奉献了自己的一生做了一件重要的事情——让奴隶们获得自由。”&nbsp;<br>
            “你的选择很好！”&nbsp;爸爸说。<br>
            “谢谢。”&nbsp;乔伊把枫糖浆倒在薄饼上，想了一会儿。她会成为哈丽特·塔布曼那样的伟大领袖吗？
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Harriet Tubman," Joy said. "She spent her whole life working for something important: getting slaves to freedom."<br>
            "Good choice," said Dad. <br>
            "Thanks." Joy poured maple syrup on her pancakes, thinking for a minute. Would she ever be a great leader like Harriet Tubman?
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “爸爸，”&nbsp;乔伊慢慢地说，“你小的时候，长大了想做什么？”&nbsp;<br>
            爸爸笑了，“我想在公园里工作，照顾树木。”&nbsp;<br>
            “现在你帮助大家回收废物的同时，不也在照顾树木嘛！”&nbsp;凯蒂说。<br>
            爸爸笑了，“算是吧。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Dad," Joy said slowly. "When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?" <br>
            Dad smiled. "I wanted to work in a park, taking care of trees."<br>
            "Now when you help people recycle waste, you also take care of trees!" Katie said.   <br>
            Dad laughed. "I guess I do."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “爷爷，您呢？”&nbsp;凯蒂问。爷爷在柳树溪做了30年的邮递员。<br>
            “从我九岁起，就想当一个邮递员了。”&nbsp;爷爷说，“我喜欢看人们收到特别信件或包裹时的微笑。”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "What about you, Grandpa?" asked Katie. Grandpa had been a mailman in Willow Creek for thirty years. <br>
            "I knew I wanted to be a mailman since I was nine years old," Grandpa said. "I loved seeing people smile when they got a special letter or package."
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我一直想当一个图书管理员。”&nbsp;妈妈紧接着说，“你们呢？”&nbsp;<br>
            “我要当柳树溪的市长！”&nbsp;凯蒂大声说。<br>
            爸爸笑了，“那很适合你。”&nbsp;<br>
            乔伊也开心地笑了。“我想当一个兽医。”&nbsp;她说。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "I always wanted to be a librarian," Mom said next. "What about you girls?" <br>
            "I'm going to be the mayor of Willow Creek!" Katie announced. <br>
            Dad laughed. "That's perfect for you." <br>
            Joy grinned from ear to ear. "I want to be a vet," she said.
        </div>

        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “这些工作都很棒，”&nbsp;爷爷说，“因为都是帮助别人的事，就像领袖们一样，也和你们俩做的一样。”&nbsp;<br>
            双胞胎看着对方笑了。“所以，姐姐，”&nbsp;凯蒂说，“你吃完薄饼了吗？”&nbsp;<br>
            “嗯，吃完了。”&nbsp;乔伊回答说，“我们该去玩儿雪了！”&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Those are great jobs," Grandpa said, "because they're about helping others just like leaders do, and like sisters do too."<br>
            The twins smiled at each other. "So, sister," Katie said. "Are you done with your pancakes yet?"<br>
            "Yep. I'm done," Joy replied. "Time to go play in the snow!"
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            凯蒂已经站在门口了。“接着！”&nbsp;说着，她把乔伊的靴子扔了过去。<br>
            乔伊笑着接住了靴子。有时候，她希望自己有个姐姐；有时候，她希望自己有个妹妹。但今天，她为自己和凯蒂是双胞胎，而感到开心。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            Katie was already by the door. "Catch!" she said, tossing Joy's boots at her. <br>
            Joy laughed as she caught the boots. Sometimes she wished she had an older sister. Other times she wished she had a younger sister. But today she was glad that she and Katie were twins.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="t0 text_size simsun">
            “我们是一对双胞胎，很有意思吧？”&nbsp;乔伊问。<br>
            “是的。”&nbsp;凯蒂回答，“有时候，做你的双胞胎姐妹，才会更有意思哦！”&nbsp;<br>
            就这样，柳树溪双胞胎姐妹一起冲进了雪地里。
        </div>
        <div class="t2 text_size" style="display:none">
            "Isn't it fun being a twin sister?" Joy asked. <br>
            "Yes," answered Katie. "Sometimes it's even fun being your twin sister!"<br>
            Then the Willow Creek twins raced out into the snow together.
