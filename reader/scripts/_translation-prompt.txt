Translate the given text in `<story>` and give a breakdown and explanations.
Format your response as a JSON object with the exact structure specified below.
The JSON must include a component breakdown with short explanations and a note explaining important concepts in the sentence.
Especially make sure to explain grammatical concepts.
Also include a word-by-word translation in the format `让 (Let) 我们 (us) 吃 (eat) 午饭 (lunch).`.

IMPORTANT:
- Make sure to replicate the JSON structure precisely with all specified fields in the given order.
- When you discover compounds like verb-object compounds, add the base word to the explanation.
- CRUCIAL: Make sure to treat every line as a single sentence and provide a breakdown. Do not combine multiple sentences into a single breakdown.

Example input:
```
小猫到处找。
小奶牛也到处找。
```
